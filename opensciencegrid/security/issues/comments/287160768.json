For example, the first broken link in your table appears [on this page](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/security/IncidentDiscoveryReporting/) and can be fixed via the following procedure:\r\n\r\n1. Click the [Edit on Github](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/security/edit/master/docs/IncidentDiscoveryReporting.md) link in the top right\r\n1. Fix the offending link target in the markdown window\r\n1. Preview your changes\r\n1. Once satisfied with your changes, add a short description for your change\r\n1. Click the second radio button for creating a new branch and starting a pull request, then submit the proposed changes\r\n\r\nBinary files like PDFs don't do well in version control systems. \r\n",
