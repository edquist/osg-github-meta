For example, the first broken link in your table appears on this page <https://opensciencegrid.github.io/security/IncidentDiscoveryReporting/>  and can be fixed via the following procedure:\n\n1.\tClick the Edit on Github <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/security/edit/master/docs/IncidentDiscoveryReporting.md>  link in the top right\n2.\tFix the offending link target in the markdown window\n3.\tPreview your changes\n4.\tOnce satisfied with your changes, add a short description for your change\n5.\tClick the second radio button for creating a new branch and starting a pull request, then submit the proposed changes\n\nBinary files like PDFs don't do well in version control systems.\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/opensciencegrid/security/pull/1#issuecomment-287160768> , or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AUOT1l8bjbwqbiu-V4O4aGM6s6AXjtTvks5rmYiWgaJpZM4MfuR2> .\n\n",
