  "body": "I'd like you to strongly consider making use of the features in the [package that I developed](https://git.ligo.org/lvcomputing/cvmfs-config-osg/tree/master/debian) from yours. I prefer to have them merged back up into your management rather than keep them myself because then we automatically get the actual underlying OSG configuration changes.\r\n\r\n* Make use of /etc/auto.master.d\r\n* Reload autofs map on behalf of user after installation / removal\r\n\r\nThe combination of these obviates the need for the user to execute any extra-steps post-installation or removal. I'm happy to turn this into a formal PR.\r\n\r\nFWIW: the package available on OBS had a higher version # than the one in the LIGO repos and it took me a while to figure out what was going wrong with my test CVMFS installation. Let's work together on this!",
