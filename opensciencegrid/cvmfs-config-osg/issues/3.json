  "body": "This PR makes cvmfs-config-osg buildable for Debian/Ubuntu on the openSUSE Build Service (OBS). This will become part of the new \"cvmfs-contrib\" repository maintained there (by me).  There will be both Debian/Ubuntu and CentOS versions of the cvmfs-contrib repository, but cvmfs-config-osg is only needed there for Debian, since the OSG doesn't have its own corresponding Debian repository.  This PR also defines cvmfs-config-osg as a Debian cvmfs-config virtual package by adding both Provides and Conflicts of cvmfs-config.\r\n\r\nI have done a [test build](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:drdaved:cvmfs-contrib/cvmfs-config-osg) of this package on OBS using the package files from this PR.",
