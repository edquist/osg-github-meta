  "body": "It may not be leaping out from the above... At no point have I made the recommendation to actively enable `autofs` via CVMFS or related packages. In fact, I disagree with the approach taken by `cvmfs-auto-setup`. No package should actively change the state of a different package's service. `postinst/postrm` scripts typically respect the configured state of the service packaged within. I can't say that I've ever seen one that changes another package's service state.\r\n\r\nSo, I think that approach could use some re-thinking.\r\n\r\nRe: `auto.master.d/cvmfs.autofs`... The only situation I can see in which the presence of this file on Debian or RedHat platforms could possibly be bad is one in which `autofs` is running, but it is being avoided for CVMFS. Is this a real world issue?\r\n\r\nIf so, I agree that another package for `/etc/auto.master.d/cvmfs.autofs` is not unreasonable. This package should respect the configured state of the `autofs` service but reload the map in a manner like I suggest. On Debian, I would suggest that this package be in a \"Recommends\" relationship with `cvmfs` so that User X installs it by default, but User Y can avoid it . I do not know if there is a similar relationship in RPMs.",
