  "body": "@DrDaveD This isn't a precedent so much as not having prioritized the adoption of a feature that I believe wasn't introduced until RHEL7. For example, a few months after the release of RHEL7, @jblomer [wrote a ticket to himself](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CVM-675) suggesting its adoption. @bbockelm also [requested its adoption](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CVM-1238) as has @rptaylor [here](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CVM-1426). The timing of the last report is suggestive that this PR was noticed or discussed on another list?\r\n\r\nI agree that the perfect place for this file is the `cvmfs` package itself. I try not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good, but perhaps @jblomer is willing to adopt it following this example?\r\n\r\nI believe (strongly) that post-installation steps are an _intrinsic evil_ that increase support costs because, well, people don\u2019t read things on a monitor very carefully. We have technical options for eliminating these post-installation steps and we should use them. I\u2019m curious what @jblomer, @bbockelm, @rptaylor think about the idea and its proper location(s)?\r\n\r\nRe: \u201cautofs isn\u2019t really required so we shouldn\u2019t X/Y/Z\u201d. `cvmfs` on RedHat does actually require the installation of `autofs`. On Debian, `cvmfs` \u201cRecommends\u201d `autofs` (which I\u2019ve come to believe is the correct dependency) and the default behavior of apt-get is `\u2014install-recommends`. So, in practice, the installation of `autofs` is automatic on all platforms and it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to automate its configuration.\r\n\r\nThe Debian-way -- in contrast to RedHat -- is to enable and start services when they are installed (unless the service had previously been masked/disabled). `autofs` follows this approach. So, installing `cvmfs` is quite likely to also start `autofs`. So it\u2019s reasonable (on Debian) to also reload the autofs maps _if and only if_ the service is presently enabled and running. Given that it's a no-op when `autofs` is disabled, it may even be a reasonable step on RedHat. This is what the `postinst/postrm` scripts you note below do. I have no idea what the RPM equivalent approach to this would be.",
