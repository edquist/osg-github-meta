  "body": "Likewise, on Redhat the autofs reload is part of the installation instructions after manual creation of `/etc/auto.master.d/cvmfs.autofs`, not part of any cvmfs package.  The same for postrm.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make it easy for the system administrator, there could be a separate package called `cvmfs-autofs` or `cvmfs-autofs-config` which we could put in the cvmfs-contrib repository.  I suggest making a CVM ticket for that creating it in a new github repo.  Then if Jakob agrees he can import that into the cvmfs github project and I can build it for the cvmfs-contrib repository.",
