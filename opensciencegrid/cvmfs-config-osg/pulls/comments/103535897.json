  "body": ">    I think this should have a Requires statement for autofs. After only designates only the sequencing, not the dependency.\r\n\r\nAdded.  It does not replace the After functionality, so need both.\r\n\r\n>    Might also be possible to put a requirement on the /cvmfs mount itself.\r\n\r\nI don't see how.\r\n\r\n>    Automatic restart?\r\n\r\nI don't know what you mean by that.\r\n\r\n>    Is the PID file actually necessary for a service of type simple?\r\n\r\nOh, you're right.  I assumed it was needed so systemd would be able to kill it, but it must keep track of the PID separately.\r\n\r\n> Can we make it so we can restart this service whenever autofs is restarted?\r\n\r\nOh, maybe that's what you meant by \"Automatic restart?\"  Yes that would be good.  As a matter of fact, the \"Requires\" and \"After\" already make this service restart with \"systemctl restart autofs\".  They do not make it start after \"systemctl stop autofs\" (that stops cvmfs-config-osg) followed by \"systemctl start autofs\" (that does not start cvmfs-config-osg).  For that, I believe a \"WantedBy=autofs.service\" in the [Install] section would normally work, but it doesn't, I think because there is not actually an autofs.service file in the autofs package (it is just inferred by /etc/init.d/autofs).  It does however work to do \"ln -s ../cvmfs-config-osg.service /lib/systemd/system/autofs.service.wants/cvmfs-config-osg.service\", I will add that to the package.\r\n",
