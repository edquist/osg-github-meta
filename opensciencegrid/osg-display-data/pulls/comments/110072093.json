  "body": "Yeah......  I had to ask myself that too when I was reviewing the changes.  But i decided it was a worthy change.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a bunch of the functions throughout the file go back and forth between spaces and tabs within individual functions -- which is really not proper in python.  I didn't try to fix it everywhere, either; i just did it in the functions that i was updating in this PR.  But i did make a separate commit for the whitespace-only changes, because i am really not a fan of putting functional changes and whitespace cleanup into the same commit.",
