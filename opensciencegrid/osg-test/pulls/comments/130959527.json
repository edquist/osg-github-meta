Note that all tests have to be compatible with Python 2.4; when reading the docs for `unittest`, keep note of when a feature was introduced.\n+\n+### Test Sequence\n+\n+During a test run, the test modules are run in sequence as follows:\n+\n+| File                 | When                                          | Purpose                                                               |\n+|:---------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| `special_user.py`    | Tests not suppressed, or explicitly requested | Add user (if asked), Check user, Set up mapfile                       |\n+| `special_install.py` | Packages given                                | Check repositories, Clean yum cache, Install packages                 |\n+| `test_NN_*.py`       | Tests not suppressed                          | Configure, Test, Tear down                                            |\n+| `special_cleanup.py` | Explicitly requested                          | Remove user (if added), Remove packages (if installed)                |\n+\n+The `test_*` modules are organized roughly into three phases, based on the sequence number of the file:\n+\n+| Test Files       | Purpose   |\n+|:-----------------|:----------|\n+| `test_[00-29]_*` | Set up    |\n+| `test_[30-69]_*` | Tests     |\n+| `test_[70-99]_*` | Tear down |\n+\n+Coding Tips\n+-----------\n+\n+It is important to know the basics of the Python `unittest` module; [read the documentation for it](http://docs.python.org/release/2.4.3/lib/module-unittest.html). We build on top of the `unittest` module, by providing an `osgunittest` module that inherits from it.\n+\n+### Basic Structure of a Test Module\n+\n+Each test module must import the `osgunittest` library, plus whichever of the `osg-test` libraries are needed (conventionally with shortened aliases):\n+\n+```python\n+import osgunittest\n+\n+import osgtest.library.core as core\n+import osgtest.library.files as files\n+```\n+\n+Then, a single test class is defined, deriving from =osgunittest.OSGTestCase=; the individual tests are sequentially numbered functions within the class:",
