Note that all tests have to be compatible with Python 2.4; when reading the docs for `unittest`, keep note of when a feature was introduced.\n+\n+### Test Sequence\n+\n+During a test run, the test modules are run in sequence as follows:\n+\n+| File                 | When                                          | Purpose                                                               |\n+|:---------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| `special_user.py`    | Tests not suppressed, or explicitly requested | Add user (if asked)&lt;br&gt;Check user&lt;br&gt;Set up mapfile       |",
