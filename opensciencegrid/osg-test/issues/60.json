We didn't have a complete PBS blind spot in the tests because the `condor_ce_trace_pbs` jobs seemed to run fine...\r\n\r\n\\* We stopped the service because we had to run `service pbs create` to create the initial config and it did a bad job of stopping the service afterwards, which we needed to do to drop additional config (maybe?).\r\n\r\n** We really shouldn't be setting `core.state` variables in our library functions, at the very least, not the `<service name>.started-service` keys because it makes following service state confusing.\r\n\r\n",
