  "body": "This adds testing of the LCMAPS VOMS plugin to the nightlies, replacing the gridmap auth we were testing before. Other things to note:\r\n\r\n* The suite still tests `edg-mkgridmap`and `glexec` individually.\r\n* Force GSI auth in HTCondor-CE to ensure that the LCMAPS auth gets exercised. Before it would just fallback to FS auth.\r\n* I'm not sure if XRootd + LCMAPS auth gets exercised (my guess is it doesn't) but added the env variables anyway\r\n",
