  "body": "Yeah, which is a bit confusing to me because those tests did not have calls to `skip_ok_unless_installed()` for the bestman2 packages...\r\n\r\nI've added `@osgrelease(3.3)` decorators to the rest of the `test_52_bestman` tests, but I wonder if this is really the way we want to handle the issue in SOFTWARE-2759.  From yesterday:\r\n\r\nhttp://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/20180111-1933/results.html\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `@osgrelease(3.3)` tests still show up in the list, only as `ok` instead of `okskip`.  Perhaps what we really want is a way to exclude the unwanted tests from the list to run, rather than reporting them as `ok` instead of `okskip`?",
