  "body": "Alright, so two separate things here:\r\n\r\n1. I agree in principle, we don't need to include decorators on everything. If for some reason we need to support a package in version N that is only available in version N-1, we just won't apply the decorator. \r\n1. Yes, we put in that effort as a courtesy to our users because of the short notice of the retirement. However, if a user comes to us with a 3.3 GUMS and a 3.4 CE/gridftp server/etc, our recommendation to them should be an LCMAPS VOMS transition.\r\n\r\nSo @edquist the takeaway from this conversation is that we want decorated tests that are not run to be added to an `excluded` list",
