These patches can be generated with git diff. \n\nhttps://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/TestRunsAsVMs\n\nIf the `checkdatabase_condor_meter` can be run with either GRAM or the HTCondor-CE, you can use the `skip_ok_unless_one_installed` function (https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-test/blob/master/osgtest/library/core.py#L334). Then you'll want to change the bad skip referencing `globus-gatekeeper.running` to something like the following\n\n```\ncore.bad_skip_unless(core.state['globus-gatekeeper.running'] or \n                     core.state['condor-ce.started'],\n                     \"gateway software not running\")\n```\n",
