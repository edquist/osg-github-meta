In that case the changes look good.\r\n\r\nI'm kicking off another VMU run using this branch to make sure everything goes ok, and then we can merge this.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the [previous run](http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/20180125-1905/results.html), you'll see that even the EL7 tests show the new tests (like `test_05_copy_local_to_server_gfal2_util`) as `excluded` -- so they never ran at all.\r\n\r\nThis is because in the [os release decorator](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-test/pull/113/commits/8134721186bd9ebed1cdecc6f87b043c8127fe9c#diff-838184dd6ca065ba35252cc39c9d2cfeR747), `releases` were mapped to `str`s, which never compare as equal to the value of `el_release()`, which is always an `int`.  (The osg releases were mapped to `str` because that's what `osg_release()` returns.) ... Anyway, it should be fixed in 314ddc0.",
