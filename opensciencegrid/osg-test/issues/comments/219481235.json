This would also mean updates to the test framework to accommodate the new test result state in the reporting. Alternatively, we can just treat them as failures and check if `status == -1` and prepend the user's message with `TIMEOUT` or some such similar text.\n\nOpinions @osg-cat, @matyasselmeci ?\n",
