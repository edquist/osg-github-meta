  "body": "Yay... Looks like this simplifies the PBS server logic a lot.\r\n\r\nJust to make a note of it here: As alluded to in the PR comments, with these changes we are now doing the sort-of-hacky replacement for `service pbs_server create` on all platforms (instead of just on EL7), because the `create` function in the `pbs_server` init.d script was causing problematic side effects for our tests.\r\n\r\nThere is kind of a lot that's changed here, but the successful VMU test run gives some additional confidence that things are now working as expected.",
