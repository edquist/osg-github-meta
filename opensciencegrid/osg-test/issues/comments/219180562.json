  "body": "Ah!  You're right; while the status returned by `core.system` will be `-1` on timeout, `check_system` doesn't do anything specific with it -- the failure message will include `EXIT STATUS: -1`, but (I'm guessing) it would be clearer if the failure message specifically said it timed out.  (We can add this in `core.diagnose` by checking if `status == -1`.)\n\n(So, to repeat: yes, currently the only way for the caller of `check_system` to detect a timeout would be to see if the failure message matches `EXIT STATUS: -1`.)\n\nBut, currently the only way `check_system` communicates a failed check to the caller is by the failed assert throwing an AssertionError, right?  So as for the caller detecting that `check_system` had a timeout, I suppose we could have `check_system` throw a new exception type (TimeoutError or something).  I'm open to suggestions.\n\nI haven't tested adding timeouts to any tests yet, no :wink:  ...I can get back to you on that...\n",
