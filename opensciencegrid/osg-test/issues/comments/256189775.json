  "body": "Ah ok, closer investigation shows on EL6, failures were due to:\n1. A bad reference to the `tomcat` service name\n2. `voms-admin` and `xrootd` services returning incorrect exit codes when checking the status (both return 1, should be 3)\n3. `pbs_mom` appears to leave its pid file behind after shutting down\n\nI've added a comment for 1. and will fix 2. after we fix the `voms-admin` and `xrootd` services.\n",
