  "body": "After learning more about fork/exec/waitpid, I'm mostly satisfied with the changes but I do have questions:\n- If I'm reading this correctly, `check_system` will fail on timeouts but will not differentiate between timeout and other failures. I think we should probably edit the failure message in the case of timeouts (and maybe create a specific timeout type of test failure status i.e. badskip?)\n- Have you run a timeout test in osg-test to make sure the TestRunner handles everything properly?\n",
