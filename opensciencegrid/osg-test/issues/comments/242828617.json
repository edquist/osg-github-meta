  "body": "Thanks @brianhlin and @matyasselmeci !  I've updated the PR to conditionalize it based on the version.\n\nI made new a little wrapper function, `package_version_compare`, which combines `get_package_envra` and `version_compare`, and avoids having to manually break open the envra tuple and reassemble it as (e,v,r).\n\nI kicked off a (very small) VMU run against `edquist:software-2398-gridftp-probe; 3.3; osg-development` and `osg-release` to see if everything's in order.\n",
