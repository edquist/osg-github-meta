  "body": "Thanks, as always, for the thorough review. I've fixed the membership check. \r\n\r\nAs for `core.options.extrarepos` getting replaced with `['osg-contrib']` for slurm packages, the only case where it would matter would be if a user wanted to install slurm through a separate repository. I don't think this is a use case we really expect to test in the nightlies and if a user wanted to test this manually, they could pre-install the slurm packages they're interested in. \r\n",
