  "body": "Ok, so, as I read it the OrderedDict thing does address the goal of this PR.  Feel free to merge.\r\n\r\nNote though that the only place the OrderedDict (or, rather, a dictionary at all) is relevant is in [this slurm packages section](https://github.com/brianhlin/osg-test/blob/84e4c1e7308f6ac21c6bc6833ccf889c4cf3f15c/osgtest/tests/special_install.py#L35-L38) (without that, just a simple `list` could be used.)\r\n\r\nAlso note that in that section, `core.options.extrarepos` gets replaced with `['osg-contrib']` for the slurm packages, rather than added to the list of extra repos.  Brian assures me that this doesn't matter  ;)\r\n\r\nAlso, not specific to this PR but related to that section, [here](https://github.com/brianhlin/osg-test/blob/84e4c1e7308f6ac21c6bc6833ccf889c4cf3f15c/osgtest/tests/special_install.py#L35), the membership test does not actually take advantage of the fact that a dictionary is used because `pkg_repo_dict.keys()` returns a `list` object ... to use the dictionary to test membership you actually want to test just the condition `x in pkg_repo_dict`.",
