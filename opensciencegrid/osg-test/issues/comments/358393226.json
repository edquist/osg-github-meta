  "body": "@brianhlin, the above commit 344e5b6 creates a separate `excluded` category/list for the decorated tests run on the wrong osg series.  I'm not sure what the travis-ci failure is about.\r\n\r\nHere's a VMU run with the above:\r\nhttp://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/20180116-1233/packages.html\r\n\r\nThe list of tests at the top looks fine for `excluded` tests, but the detailed `EXCLUDED` section below (after `OK SKIPS`) for some reason shows the python traceback instead of just the oneline summary as seen in the `OK SKIPS` section.  Not sure what I missed there but I'm guessing we don't want it quite as-is yet.",
