  "body": "The tests are one run of gsissh to see if we can connect and run a\nsimple command, and two runs of gsiscp to see if we can copy files\nto/from the remote server.  These tests require gsi-openssh-server,\ngsi-openssh-clients, and a proxy.  The code for setting up the file\ntransfer tests was based off of the gfal2 test code.\n\nA more global change: I changed special_user.py to give the vdttest user\na randomly-generated password.  SSH (including GSISSH) will consider a\nuser 'disabled' and refuse to log in as that user if the user does not\nhave a valid encrypted password in /etc/shadow.\n",
