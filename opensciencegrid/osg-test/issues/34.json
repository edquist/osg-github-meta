  "body": "This commit contains two major features:\n- VOMS tests have been changed so that most of them will run without\n  voms-admin.\n- Code for using voms (setting up a vo, adding a user, tearing down the\n  vo) has been moved to a separate library named `voms.py`, which can be\n  imported and used standalone.\n  \n  By default, none of the functions require voms-admin, but two of them,\n  `create_vo()` and `add_user()` have a `use_voms_admin` parameter which\n  causes them to use the voms-admin-based code instead of the rewritten\n  versions. The tests take advantage of this, using voms-admin if it is\n  available.\n\nBecause many of the test functions have the same requirements (voms\nclient/server/mysql-plugin, mysql client/server, and, for EL 7, a\nminimum version of voms-server), `voms.py` contains `is_installed()` and\n`skip_ok_unless_installed()` to verify that the packages to run and use\na voms server are installed.\n\n(SOFTWARE-2346)\n",
