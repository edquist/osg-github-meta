  "body": "[SOFTWARE-2383](https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2383)\n### Test results\n- [With nightly=False (the default)](http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/20160906-1532/results.html) with the following failures:\n  - MyProxy tests failing with 3.3 testing because I didn't grab d1177fc from master\n  - Handful of random RHEL7 install and VM startup failures\n- [With nightly=True](http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/20160906-1533/results.html) with the following failures:\n  - Same MyProxy and RHEL7 install failures as above\n  - Random Bestman/Gfal2 (1x) and EL5 SSL yum failures (4x)\n### Summary\n\nAdded a nightly option that will give us the flexibility to speed up tests in the future for any manual VMU runs so that developers won't have to wait as long for their results. Specifically in this change, we are disabling Tomcat persistence for EL6+ tests since we don't have to bother surviving restarts of the service.\n\nBy default, osg-test uses these sped up tests and the nightly test infrastructure will specify that it has a higher tolerance for lengthy test runs.\n",
