I spot checked the tests to verify that they're correctly enabling SELinux (or not in the first case): \n- VMU tests with SELinux disabled (default): http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/20160428-1329/results.html\n  - 3.3 ALL tests are due to #7, which was merged after these tests were kicked off\n  - Random errors appear unrelated\n- VMU tests with SELinux enabled: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/20160428-1335/results.html\n  - 3.3 ALL tests are due to #7, which was merged after these tests were kicked off\n  - EL6 CMVFS and cleanup test failures, presumably due to enabled SELinux\n  - EL7 HTCondor-CE, RSV, and Globus-Condor job submission failures, presumably due to enabled SELinux\n",
