  "body": "This PR outlines a release process for getting the `gracc-collector` into the official OSG build repository and OSG org on Docker Hub.  I've tested this end-to-end: once merged, I'll only need to update the DockerHub branch settings.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with this as a line-in-the-sand.  However, since it hooks into the official OSG RPM build infrastructure, there's a significant 'wait for GOC update to run' step in the middle.  Not only does that slow the release process, but it also necessitates separate commit to trigger the DockerHub build.  In the future, I hope to investigate something like packagecloud.io so the yum repository creation is more automated and doing a GitHub-based release results in the CI doing the packaging for us.\r\n\r\nHuman steps are steps where things go wrong!",
