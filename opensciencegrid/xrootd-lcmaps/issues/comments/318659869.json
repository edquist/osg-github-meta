  "body": "Yeah, I think you're right.  The openssl docs state:\r\n\r\n> If the `BIO_CLOSE` flag is set when a memory BIO is freed then the underlying `BUF_MEM` structure is also freed.\r\n\r\nMy original reading of the sentence is that the underlying *memory* is freed (we don't want that - BIO doesn't own the memory!).  However, I think `BUF_MEM` is something else in this context and we do want to free it.  Certainly, given the size of the memory leaks (24 bytes!), it's not actually leaking the credential chain.",
