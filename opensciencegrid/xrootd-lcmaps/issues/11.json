Creating a new request as this is a different implementation using unique_ptr.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n- proxy_depth is incremented and never cleared during validation\r\n- max_proxy_depth is modified if the proxy has a path-length limit set\r\n\r\nAfter a context validates a certificate with a path-length limit, subsequent validations may fail with \"Proxy path length exceeded\" errors.\r\n\r\nAllocate a new callback struct with unique_ptr for each validation.",
