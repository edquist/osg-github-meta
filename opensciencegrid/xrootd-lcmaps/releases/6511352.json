  "body": "Under heavy load, it was possible for the `xrootd-lcmaps` plugin to cause the `xrootd` daemon to segfault.  This was due to a race condition in the certificate handling code - the periodic reload of trust roots (CAs, CRLs) was done with improper locking.\r\n\r\nThis is now fixed; a pre-release version has been running stably at Nebraska for several weeks.",
