See:\r\n\r\nhttps://philwrightdev.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/providing-a-custom-deleter-to-stdunique_ptr/\r\n\r\nI agree with their sentiment:\r\n\r\n> I prefer to use a lambda, as I can write it locally to the where it\u2019ll be used, and don\u2019t have to create a separate function, or class, whose purpose, or caller, might not be obvious without a comment.\r\n\r\n(of course, they then proceed with all the downsides of the approach ... oh well!)",
