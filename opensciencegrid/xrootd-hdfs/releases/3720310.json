  "body": "This bugfix release tweaks the runtime environment to allow HDFS to load its native libraries.\n\nThe native libraries contain heavily-optimized code for performance critical sections (such as checksum calculations); without them, the `libhdfs` library will fall back to the slower Java equivalents when used from `xrootd-hdfs`.\n",
