  "body": "Lots of changes:\r\n\r\n1. Changed format of config file for fife reports.  Now, these match OSG config file format (in that they have the report as the top level, and then any extra stuff).\r\n2. Changed the index pattern module, so that we have dynamically-generated and configurable index patterns.  We specify any number of index patterns in the config file, and then the various reports can pass that into the Reporter instantiation as the kwarg _index_key_.  The default value for this is is **index_pattern**.  Furthermore, the IndexPattern module's **indexpattern_generate** function will now return 'gracc.osg.summary' as a default.\r\n3.  Added alternate host attribute _althost_ to Reporter class.  This allows us to put multiple ES hosts in the config file, and select which one we want when instantiating the Reporter class. \r\n4.  Lots and lots of code refactoring (ternary statements, defaultdict, etc).\r\n5. Addition of a new report - Top Wasted Hours by VO to the fife-reports subpackage.\r\n6. Deprecation of report - Wasted Hours from fife-reports subpackage\r\n ",
