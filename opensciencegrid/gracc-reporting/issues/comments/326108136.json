The idea with regard to the config file would be that we'd then have something like the following:\r\n\r\nraw = \"gracc.osg.raw\"\r\nsummary = \"gracc.osg.summary\"\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe index pattern function would then take the config value and attach date information as needed.  Perhaps we'd do config validation in the ReportUtils:Reporter.indexpattern_generate method",
