  "body": "This is a minor release that mainly affects the Job Success Rate Report under FIFE Reports.  In 1.0, we added functionality to allow for multiple elasticsearch hosts and multiple index pattern format strings to be put in the same config file.  This release uses those, and the JSR is now written to use the data sources at Fermilab, rather than the OSG GRACC.  There should be no breaking changes to any OSG reports here.\r\n\r\nOne known issue (will be fixed in 1.1.1) is that the time-zone support for creating Fifemon links in the Job Success Rate Report and Efficiency Report got broken somehow.
