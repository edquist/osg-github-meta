  "body": "This PR is big so all help and eyes are appreciated (@matyasselmeci , @edquist). The bulk of the changes are due to the new parameter file format and changes made to accommodate it: \r\n\r\n- New `PackageSet` class \r\n- Changes to the VMU module\r\n- Tests for the VMU module (requires mock)\r\n- Updates to the DAG scripts \r\n\r\nThis new format gives us a much better VMU to osg-test interface and finer control over sets of tests: the actual [SELinux implementation](a28a759) is small and we could just as easily add other osg-test options (maybe add osg-test's `timeout` option so devs can control VMU payload timeouts?).\r\n\r\nAnd of course, results using the aforementioned changes: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/20161215-1336/results.html",
