  "body": "No, they do not conflict.  The conflict is with `osg-gridftp-xrootd` + hdfs.  I believe yum actually prevents you from installing both because `gridftp-hdfs` and `xrootd-dsi` both provide the file `/usr/share/osg/sysconfig/globus-gridftp-server-plugin`.  (`osg-gridftp-xrootd` brings in `xrootd-dsi` and `osg-gridftp-hdfs` brings in `gridftp-hdfs`.)\r\n\r\nWhether `xrootd` and `xrootd-lcmaps` are needed or useful with `xrootd-hdfs` (as opposed to `osg-gridftp-xrootd`) is a separate question, and I don't fully understand the answer myself.",
