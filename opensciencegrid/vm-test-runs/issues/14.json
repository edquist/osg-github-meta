  "body": "https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2437\n\nI did not handle the case where a user removes all of the {{test-run.dag}} jobs, which results in the following error: `Analysis output file analyze-test-run.out in /osgtest/runs/run-20160901-1128 is empty`. If you remove the DAG in its entirety then the error doesn't occur and I figured that would be the only case where a user would remove all of the jobs. I could handle that use case but it would require deeper surgery that I thought would be unreasonable for this change.\n\nThere's also a stray commit in there for refactoring the reporting jobs.\n",
