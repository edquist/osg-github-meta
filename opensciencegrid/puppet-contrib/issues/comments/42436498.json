  "body": "Hi Tapas,\nCan you reorganize this slightly? It should be more like HepWisc/modules/condor/... instead of condorHepWisc/...\nThat way you won't be creating a new top-level directory for each module you contribute. It's also the layout described in the wiki document linked in the readme.\nOtherwise, it looks good. Thank you for your contribution!\n",
