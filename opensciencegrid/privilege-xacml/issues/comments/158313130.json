  "body": "Thanks @bbockelm.\n\n> How about we create a branch-2 on the commit just before this one? OSG is just starting the transition to CANL and we might need to do a further 2.6 maintenance release.\n\nYes, I think that would be a very good idea. In dCache we have feature releases every 4 months and we keep doing patch level releases of previous feature releases for two years, so having the old version of the library maintained would benefit us too.\n\n> I don't have anything slated for the 3.0.0 release except this. Are you in a good place for doing verification of 3.0.0 within dCache? I would hope to tag in the next week or so.\n\nYes, we can do that. @DmitryLitvintsev already tested a patched dCache against this branch of the XACML library and concluded that it works.\n\n> We haven't been uploading to maven central. Would this be something you need?\n\nIt is not a requirement for dCache as we maintain our own Nexus installation to which we upload libraries not found in Maven central. That being said, it is always convenient if libraries are in Maven central.\n",
