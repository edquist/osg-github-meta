  "body": "Hi Gerd,\n\nWhen I run `mvn dependency:analyze`, it picks up all those as dependencies as a used during compile time.  For example, focusing on `joda-time`, I get a complaint if I drop it from the direct dependencies.  Really, I think this indicates I'm compensating for a missing indirect dependency.  Do you have any tips on how to nail down the problematic POM?\n\nCertainly, I think `wsdl4j` can be moved to compile-only.  \n\nBrian\n",
