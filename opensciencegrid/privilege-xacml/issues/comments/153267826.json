  "body": "Yes, CANL handles all the trust store and cert chain validation nicely and with a much more convenient API.\n\nAs for GSI and the FTP client for dCache:\n- I reimplemented GSI without the GSSAPI dependency. GSI is just TLS with a delegation step after the initial handshake (and an optional framing around the TLS frames). That's not difficult to implement. I chose to make it complicated by implementing it as a decorator for SSLEngine, mostly so I could hook this into the non-blocking I/O stuff in Jetty 9.  You can have a look at https://github.com/dCache/dcache/tree/master/modules/common-security/src/main/java/org/dcache/gsi \n- The Axis 1 support I replaced too by implementing support for the Apache HTTP components client in Axis and then adding a simple delegation step on top of that, see https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/modules/srm-common/src/main/java/org/dcache/srm/client/HttpClientSender.java, https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/modules/srm-common/src/main/java/org/dcache/srm/client/GsiHttpClientSender.java, https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/modules/srm-common/src/main/java/org/dcache/srm/client/GsiConnectionSocketFactory.java.\n- As for the FTP client, I copied the entire thing from JGlobus and updated it to use CANL and dCache classes were appropriate. Over time I will see if I can unify the data channel handling with what we use server side (server side FTP has always been pure dCache). See https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/modules/ftp-client/src/main/java/org/dcache/ftp/client/extended/GridFTPControlChannel.java for the implementation of GSI in the client. Since FTP is inherently GSSAPI like, I am relying on my own simplified version of that which I call DSSAPI :-) That's not intended to be generic in any way and doesn't come with the complications of full GSSAPI. The plugability of GSSAPI was never utilized anyway.\n\nAnother benefit of getting rid of JGlobus is that we get strict RFC 2818 support (and in dCache it isn't optional). That's still going to be a problem for some sites at the moment, but by the time the next golden release gets out (next summer), this should have been solved.\n\nOnce all this settles down, I will talk to the CANL developers and ask whether they are interested in some of the GSI stuff.\n",
