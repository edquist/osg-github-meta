  "body": "Hi @gbehrmann -\n\nLess on the patch and more on release management -\n- How about we create a branch-2 on the commit just before this one?  OSG is just starting the transition to CANL and we might need to do a further 2.6 maintenance release.\n- I don't have anything slated for the 3.0.0 release except this.  Are you in a good place for doing verification of 3.0.0 within dCache?  I would hope to tag in the next week or so.\n- We haven't been uploading to maven central.  Would this be something you need?\n\nThanks!  Patch looks great!\n\nBrian\n",
