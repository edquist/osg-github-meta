I'll keep an eye on your upstream for when we start thinking about Jetty 9.\n\nIn case you want to look at the state of bestman2, we are working on a cleanup of the source repo (upstream worked in a private CVS repo, and each release was a single commit to SVN ... among other weirdness) here: https://github.com/edquist/bestman2\n\nForking off the FTP client is probably a step too far for us: I'd rather spend our (limited) energy on this stack on porting people to other clients.\n",
