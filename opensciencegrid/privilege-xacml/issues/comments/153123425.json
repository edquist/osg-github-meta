  "body": "That was the default one in the pom (2.4.1). \n\nJust a little context so you know what I am up: I recently ported dCache from JGlobus to CANL, but in the last minute I discovered that the XACML client depends on JGlobus. I have a patch ready that ports the XAML client to the latest version of the voms lib and to CANL and thus can get rid of JGlobus. If you are interested in that I will submit a pull request (I still need to test it).\n\nThe reason why dCache moves away from JGlobus is that JGlobus has appeared more or less unmaintained for a long while and it is a huge dependency for dCache. Due to bouncy castle breaking the API often, JGlobus is now forcing us to use old versions of other libraries as JGlobus depends specifically on bouncy castle 1.46 (eg we could not upgrade to newer versions of the sshd lib due to this).\n",
