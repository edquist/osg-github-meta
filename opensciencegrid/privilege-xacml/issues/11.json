  "body": "Hi,\n\nI got some questions about the dependencies specified in the main pom. Are the following actually used:\n\njoda-time\nvelocity\nxerces\nxmlParserAPIs\nxalan\nwsdl4j\n\nwsdl4j is used during compile time for code generation, but is it actually a runtime dependency?\n\nSome of the dependencies are imported by opensaml too, but if there is no direct dependency in privilege-xacml then they should not be specified, imo.\n\nHope you can help clear this up.\n\nThanks,\n\n/gerd\n",
