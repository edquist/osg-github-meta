  "body": "Motivation:\n\nIt appears that OSGSAMLBootstrap#bootstrap is supposed to replace\nDefaultBootstrap#bootstrap, but in contrast to the latter the former fails to\ninitialize the parser pool. I suspect the parser pool initialization was added\nduring an upgrade of opensaml library and wasn't mirrored in the xacml client\nlibrary.\n\nModification:\n\nAdd a call to initializeParserPool during bootstrapping.\n\nResult:\n\nNo null pointer exception when using the XACML client.\n",
