  "body": "Hi,\n\nThe first patch in this PR ports the XACMLClient to CANL. It drops a number of unused utility functions that relied on JGlobus. Some system properties may have changed as both JGlobus and the client lib reacted to various properties. The new version recognizes CADIR, VOMSDIR, HOSTKEY and HOSTCERT. All have the expected defaults.\n\nThe second patch applies a couple of Java 5 language features to clean up the code a little.\n\nThe library now compiles without manually having to install any dependencies first - everything needed appears in Maven central.\n\nThe version number is increased to 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT due to the API and property changes. I do not expect it to be difficult to port existing code to the new library - not unless the existing code made use of the unrelated utility functions that I dropped as part of the port. It is not a problem if existing code makes direct use of JGlobus as the version of CANL used can coexist with JGlobus (same version of bouncy castle).\n",
