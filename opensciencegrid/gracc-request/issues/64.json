  "body": "Two things here:\r\n\r\n1)  The matching between raw record fields and OIM fields should now be case-insensitive.  I still create the lookup dict using the case in OIM (so the summary records retain that case), but upon matching, I force both the record field and the lookup field to lowercase.  I've added two unit tests that check this.\r\n\r\n2)  I noticed that the OIMTopology.add_matched_* methods just wrapped the output dicts from the OIMTopology.get_information_by_* and OIMTopology.check_* methods.  I simply moved those to the module level and made them decorators that I could use on the above-mentioned methods.  That cleaned up the code, and those updates passed the original unit tests and the ones I added in (1).",
