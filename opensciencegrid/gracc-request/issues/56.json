  "body": "When deciding whether or not to create a new Cache file for OIM Topology, the current time used to be evaluated when the module itself was loaded, not when the OIMTopology class was instantiated.  Therefore, as long as a worker was alive, the cachefile didn't get updated. I moved the evaluation of the time (variable curtime) into the function within OIMTopology called read_from_cache, where we decide whether or not to read the currently-stored cache file.\r\n\r\nIf this passes unit tests, we should probably deploy this as soon as possible - it's a pretty important oversight that's completely on me.",
