  "body": "Sorry, I'm really not fond of this... I would say feel free to just add a fetch config for `wip/*` branches unconditionally, as any branch with that name is probably safe to allow non-ff updates.  I'd rather make that the convention than make matyas magic the convention.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can just manually set up the config to allow non-ff updates to whatever branches you want for your personal repo backups.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think you mean `refs/heads/wip/*`, not `refs/wip/*`.  (The `refs/pull` namespace is actually separate from branches.)",
