  "body": "To me this `ps axw | grep -q [r]sync` looks like trouble...\n\nBesides the fact that it actually breaks if there is a file named `rsync` in the current directory (that is, `grep` would always succeed, as it will match its own entry from `ps` in that case), even if `[r]sync` were quoted properly it would still match any other processes with the string `rsync` anywhere in the command line.\n\nYou could test the condition of `rsync` running it a bit more directly with something like `pgrep -x rsync >/dev/null`, but there is still the question of whether you care about other rogue `rsync` processes unrelated to `osg-koji-offsite-backup` ... you could do `pgrep -x rsync -u root >/dev/null` to at least exclude user `rsync` processes from interfering ... but the problem could still be there unless you have a way to identify an `rsync` process as belonging to another instance of `osg-koji-offsite-backup` :-\\\n\nDoes it matter?  (I don't really know; what do you think?)\n\nOr would it work/make sense to search instead for another `osg-koji-offsite-backup` running?\n",
