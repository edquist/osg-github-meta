  "body": "I believe it came up in the past with the `osg-installed-versions` script from `osg-system-profiler` -- we had it handle dos line endings because occasionally `osg-profile.txt`'s attached to goc tickets acquired dos line endings.\r\n\r\nWithout the `.replace('\\r\\n', '\\n')` bit, the script in fact fails if a file has dos line endings.\r\n\r\nThe \"text mode\" you are talking about (which corresponds to the \"t\" flag to `fopen(3)`) is only relevant on dos/windows systems.  On Unix systems it doesn't have any effect.  (Try it yourself: open a dos text file and you will see that `f.readline()` returns a string ending with `'\\r\\n'`.)",
