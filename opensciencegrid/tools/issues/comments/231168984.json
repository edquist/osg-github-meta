  "body": "Good catch on the file named rsync thing - I didn't think about that.\n\nIt's not other copies of osg-koji-offsite-backup that I want to catch, but the backup script that creates the directories that I want to copy offsite in the first place, called `/usr/local/bin/backups.sh`. I suppose I could look for that directly, but what if that script gets renamed?\n\nI suppose one way of identifying rsync processes that I do watch to catch is to use lsof and look for rsync processes that have the directory tree that I want to back up opened, but it might be overkill.\n\nSo something like `lsof -c rsync +d /export/backup/$DATE`\n",
