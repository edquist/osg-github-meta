  "body": "We seem to have accumulated several low-quality reference manuals for various PKI tools (`osg-pki-tools`, `osg-ca-certs-updater`, `osg-ca-manage`).\r\n\r\nThese reference manuals basically enumerate all functionality and possible CLI options.  They don't actually walk site admins through what needs to be done for common tasks (install CA certs, get host / user cert); those are documented (better) elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I'm concatenating them into a larger \"certificate management reference\" manual.\r\n\r\nThis PR does some touchup of content, but I tried to keep things to simply moving text from point A to point B (which is a bear to review...).  Further PRs are going to tackle the actual content, making it easier to review.",
