  "body": "This PR tries to make the XRootD GridFTP material minimally not-bad.\r\n    \r\nThe old GridFTP installation document basically contained:\r\n\r\n1.  Generic GridFTP install documentation (better written elsewhere).\r\n2.  Copious suggestions that SRM is the Big Thing that should be installed (nope).\r\n3.  Installation directions for GridFTP on XRootD.\r\n4.  Install instructions for XRootD FUSE mounts.  (Not GridFTP related)\r\n5.  Install instructions for an alternate security mechanism.  (Not GridFTP related)\r\n    \r\nOf these, only (3) was actually relevant.  *Note* what the GridFTP document didn't contain: how to configure GridFTP!\r\n    \r\nAccordingly, this commit reworks the content to contain just GridFTP/XRootD install and configuration instructions, and places the additional content elsewhere.\r\n",
