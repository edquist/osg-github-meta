We need to get these migrations through at a certain velocity, and I would rather let the re-organization have an appropriate amount of time.  To follow our own advice:\r\n\r\n> If you see any other obvious errors (e.g., links to gratia web), feel free to correct them while you're editing the doc iff the changes take less than ~15 minutes. This isn't a renovation project!\r\n\r\n",
