All branches run `mkdocs build` and `linkchecker` before deployment, meaning that transient link failures can prevent deployment (I can change this)\r\n1. ITB documentation is titled differently ([see top left](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs-itb/)) but I haven't thought about how to add a warning header/change the readthedocs theme color/whatever to differentiate it from production docs. I also haven't figured out how to modify `robots.txt` so that it isn't crawled\r\n1. `doc-ci-scripts`'s `README.md` needs updated instructions",
