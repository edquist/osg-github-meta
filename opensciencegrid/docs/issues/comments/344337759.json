IMHO, I would just get rid of all of this [section](http://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/other/install-gwms-frontend/#example-of-automatic-proxy-renewal).\r\n\r\nThe thing is each frontend is different some have three proxies some have four with different DN's. I like the idea of the most simple expression of this in the docs. Then the admin of the frontend can add any other complexity he wants. But maintaining a catch all proxy generation script is a real waste of time.",
