Seems like some of these docs aren't converted as much as simply run through `pandoc` and committed.\r\n\r\nEven low-priority docs should render well and be included in the `mkdocs.yml`.  If they're low-priority enough to not put them in the table of contents, then they don't need to be converted to markdown -- they can just live in the archive.\r\n\r\n(Hm -- we should probably have a Travis-CI check to verify that all `*.md` docs are listed in `mkdocs.yml`.)",
