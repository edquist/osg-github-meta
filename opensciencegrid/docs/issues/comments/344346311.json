  "body": "If every frontend is its own special snowflake whose configuration couldn't possibly be documented, we should replace the entire proxy renewal section with \"Contact the OSG for help\". I don't think this is the case so we just need to capture our recommendations (automatic renewal via cron, use `voms-proxy-fake` under some conditions, `voms-proxy-init` under other conditions) and provide step-by-step instructions. I'm imagining an example of a script that looks like [this](http://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/data/load-balanced-gridftp/#required-configuration), just a skeleton of what we recommend.",
