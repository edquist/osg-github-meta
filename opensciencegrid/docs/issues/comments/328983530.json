  "body": "I am mostly OK with them. Pretty extensive changes though, and they'll need to be applied to the other pages as well. I had noticed the ::console in other pages but couldn't get it to work, I think because I was accidentally trying three colons. I had put in the <br> lines after code blocks because that was the only way I could get it to put enough whitespace there. It looks OK on this page but might be a problem on the cvmfs page.\r\n\r\nOne questions, though: Is it really necessary to tell people to do a complete wipe of their yum cache and update of all rpms just to install frontier-squid? I think that's a bit much.",
