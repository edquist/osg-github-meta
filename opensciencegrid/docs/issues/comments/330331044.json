Checking external URLs is an option, but is not gonna be useful for because a) missing TWiki pages don't return errors and b) it doesn't like sites using OSG or CERN or other non-standard CA certs.\r\n\r\nWe'll have to skip some URLs to avoid false positives (at least `--ignore-url='.*css/theme.css'` because the mkdocs/readthedocs CSS file itself has broken links).\r\n\r\nDoes not seem to be available on EL 7 (I was running it on Fedora 26). However, it can be built and installed via pip (pkg `python2-pip`) if the Python headers (pkg `python-devel`) are available.\r\n\r\nGiven those caveats though, I think it's worth putting it into the automated tests.",
