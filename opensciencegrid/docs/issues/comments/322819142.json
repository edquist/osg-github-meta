If you look at https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/WebHome, this document (and actually all the other documents that live in `other/` except for `gsissh.md`) are actually under the \"clients\" section.\r\n\r\nI made a PR (#15) for moving the appropriate stuff to a new `docs/client` folder; please wait until that one's merged, then move this doc to that folder, and I'll merge this as well.",
