I don't think it's appropriate to suggest anyone to download random scripts from GitHub (yes, I know we did this all the time in twiki-land: it wasn't appropriate then either).\r\n\r\nCan we delay this documentation until we can get a small RPM out the door?  Now that we've done the proof of concept, it seems there's value in getting a package out the door.\r\n\r\nBrian",
