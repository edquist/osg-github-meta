  "body": "Some small twiki-isms snuck through.  Can you scrub them out?\r\n\r\n@brianhlin - in general, I'm a bit reluctant about putting the release notes in the documentation.  I don't feel they add a whole lot -- and they certainly clutter up the ToC.\r\n\r\nTwo ideas:\r\n1.  I would be fine if we put the release notes in the technology repository and we only kept the last N (N=0, 1, 2?) release notes for each series in the docs repo.\r\n2.  Like HTCondor, concatenate all the release notes for a given series into a single page.  Migrate unsupported series pages into the technology repo.",
