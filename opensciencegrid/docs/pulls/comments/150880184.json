All of the documentation can be found [here](../../).\n+\n+Known Issues\n+------------\n+\n+-   Because the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: `WARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details`. This warning can safely be ignored.\n+-   In GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.\n+\n+        COLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False\n+\n+Updating to the new release\n+---------------------------\n+\n+To update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on [updating between release series](../release_series).\n+\n+### Update Repositories\n+\n+To update to this series, you need [install the current OSG repositories](../../common/yum#install-osg-repositories).\n+\n+### Update Software\n+\n+Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n+\n+``` console\n+root@host # yum update\n+```\n+\n+<span class=\"twiki-macro NOTE\"></span> Please be aware that running `yum update` may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the `--exclude=[package-name or glob]` option for the `yum` command.\n+\n+<span class=\"twiki-macro NOTE\"></span> Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a `.rpmnew` file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a `.rpmnew` extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the `.rpmnew` file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the `.rpmnew` extension). Watch especially for `/etc/lcmaps.db`, which every site is expected to edit.",
