If there are multiple sections with the same name you can link the subsequent sections by appending `_N` where `N` is the section's ordinal number minus one, e.g. append `_1` for the second section. For example, if you have three sections named \"Optional Configuration\", link them like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[1st section](#optional-configuration)\r\n[2nd section](#optional-configuration_1)\r\n[3rd section](#optional-configuration_2)\r\n```\r\n",

The LCMAPS VOMS plugin enables LCMAPS to make mapping decisions based on the VOMS attributes of grid certificates, e.g., `/cms/Role=production/Capability=NULL`. Starting in OSG 3.4, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin will replace GUMS and edg-mkgridmap as the authentication method at OSG sites.\n+\n+The OSG provides a default set of mappings from VOMS attributes to Unix accounts. By configuring LCMAPS, you can override these mappings, including changing the Unix account that a VO is mapped to, banning based on VOMS attributes, banning a specific user, or adding a VO, VO group, VO role, and/or user that is not in the OSG's set of mappings.\n+\n+Use this page to learn how to install and configure the LCMAPS VOMS plugin to authenticate users to access your resources on a per-VO basis.\n+\n+\n+Installing the LCMAPS VOMS Plugin\n+---------------------------------\n+\n+Install `lcmaps`, the default mapfile, and the configuration tools:\n+\n+``` console\n+[root@server]# yum install lcmaps vo-client-lcmaps-voms osg-configure-misc\n+```\n+\n+\n+Configuring the LCMAPS VOMS Plugin\n+----------------------------------\n+\n+The following section describes the steps required to configure the LCMAPS VOMS plugin for authentication. If you are using OSG 3.3 packages, there are software-specific instructions that must be followed for [HTCondor-CE](Documentation.Release3/InstallHTCondorCE), [GridFTP](Documentation.Release3/InstallOSGGridFTP), and [XRootD](Documentation.Release3/InstallXrootd). To check if you are running OSG 3.3, run the following command:\n+\n+``` console\n+[root@server]# rpm -q --queryformat=\"%{VERSION}\\n\" osg-release\n+```\n+\n+Additionally, there is [optional configuration](#OptionalConfig) if you need to make changes to the default mappings.",
