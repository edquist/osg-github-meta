This software is the minimum requirement for a VO to use glideinWMS.\n+\n+This document assumes expertise with Condor and familiarity with the glideinWMS software. It **does not** cover anything but the simplest possible install. Please consult the [Glidein WMS reference documentation](http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/doc.prd/install.html) for advanced topics, including non-`root`, non-RPM-based installation.\n+\n+This document covers three components of the GlideinWMS a VO needs to install:\n+\n+-   **User Pool Collectors**: A set of `condor_collector` processes. Pilots submitted by the factory will join to one of these collectors to form a Condor pool.\n+-   **User Pool Schedd**: A `condor_schedd`. Users may submit Condor vanilla universe jobs to this schedd; it will run jobs in the Condor pool formed by the **User Pool Collectors**.\n+-   **Glidein Frontend**: The frontend will periodically query the **User Pool Schedd** to determine the desired number of running job slots. If necessary, it will request the factory to launch additional pilots.\n+\n+This guide covers installation of all three components on the same host: it is designed for small to medium VOs (see the Hardware Requirements below). Given a significant, large host, we have been able to scale the single-host install to 20,000 running jobs.\n+\n+![alt text][logo]",
