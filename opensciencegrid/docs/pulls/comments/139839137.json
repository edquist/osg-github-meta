It is intended for site administrators wishing to verify the functionality of their HTCondor-CE installation and developers writing software to submit jobs to an HTCondor-CE (e.g., pilot jobs).\n+\n+!!! note\n+    Most incoming jobs are pilots from factories and that manual submission does not reflect the standard method that jobs are submitted to OSG CE\u2019s.\n+\n+Submitting Jobs...\n+------------------\n+\n+There are two main methods for submitting files to an HTCondor-CE: using the tools bundled with the `htcondor-ce-client` package and using the `condor_submit` command with a submit file. Both methods will test end-to-end job submission but the former method is simpler while the latter will walk you through writing your own submit file.\n+\n+Before attempting to submit jobs, you will need to generate a proxy from a user certificate before running any jobs. To generate a proxy, run the following command on the host you plan on submitting from:\n+\n+``` console\n+user@host $ voms-proxy-init\n+```\n+\n+### Using HTCondor-CE tools\n+\n+There are two HTCondor-CE tools that allow users to test the functionality of their HTCondor-CE: [condor\\_ce\\_trace](troubleshoot-htcondor-ce#condor95ce95trace) and [condor\\_ce\\_run](troubleshoot-htcondor-ce#condor95ce95run). The former is the preferred tool as it provides useful feedback if failure occurs while the latter is simply an automated submission tool. These commands may be run from any host that has `htcondor-ce-client` installed, which you may wish to do if you are testing availability of your CE from an external source.\n+\n+#### condor\\_ce\\_trace",
