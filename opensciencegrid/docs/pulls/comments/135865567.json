It provides a common environment and a minimal set of common tools that all OSG jobs can expect to use. See the [reference section](#Reference) below for contents of the Worker Node Client.\n+\n+It is possible to install the Worker Node Client software in a variety of ways, depending on what works best for distributing and managing software at your site:\n+\n+-   Use the Worker Node Client software from OASIS (this guide) - useful when [OASIS](cvmfs.md) is already mounted on your worker nodes\n+-   [Install using RPMs and Yum](wn.md) - useful when managing your worker nodes with a tool (e.g., Puppet, Chef) that can automate RPM installs\n+-   [Install using a tarball](wn-tarball.md) - useful when installing onto a shared filesystem for distribution to worker nodes\n+\n+This document is intended to guide system administrators through the process of configuring a site to make the Worker Node Client software available from OASIS.\n+\n+Before Starting\n+---------------\n+\n+As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n+\n+-   Ensure the host has [a supported operating system](../release/supported_platforms.md)\n+\n+Also note that, once configured to use OASIS, each use of Worker Node Client software will cause that software and its associated files to be downloaded from a CVMFS server or your local cache thereof. This may result in extra network activity, especially if Worker Node Client tools are used heavily.\n+\n+Configuring Your Site to Use the Worker Node Client From OASIS\n+--------------------------------------------------------------\n+\n+Below are the one-time steps that you must perform to configure your site to use the Worker Node Client software from OASIS.\n+\n+On every worker node, [install and configure OASIS](../client/cvmfs.md)\n+\n+Determine the OASIS path to the Worker Node Client software for your worker nodes:\n+\n+| Worker Node OS | Use\u2026                                                                                 |\n+|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| EL\u00a06 (32-bit)  | `/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.3/current/el6-i386`   |\n+| EL\u00a06 (64-bit)  | `/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.3/current/el6-x86_64` |\n+| EL\u00a07 (64-bit)  | `/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.3/current/el7-x86_64` |\n+\n+On the CE, in the `/etc/osg/config.d/10-storage.ini` file, set the `grid_dir` configuration setting to the path from the previous step.\n+\n+For more information, see the [OSG environment variables reference page](https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/EnvironmentVariables) and the [CE configuration instructions](https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/IniConfigurationOptions#Storage).\n+\n+Once you finish making changes to configuration files on your CE, validate, fix, and apply the configuration:\n+\n+```console\n+[root@client ~] # osg-configure -v \n+[root@client ~] # osg-configure -c\n+```\n+\n+Validating the Worker Node Client\n+---------------------------------\n+\n+To verify functionality of the worker node client, you will need to submit a test job against your CE and verify the job's output.\n+\n+1.  Submit a job that executes the `env` command (e.g. Run [condor\\_ce\\_trace](https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/TroubleshootingHTCondorCE#condor_ce_trace) with the `-d` flag from your HTCondor CE)\n+2.  Verify that the value of `OSG_GRID` is set to the directory of your WN Client installation\n+\n+### Manually Using the Worker Node Client From OASIS\n+\n+If you must log onto a worker node and use the Worker Node Client software directly during your login session, consult the following table for the command to set up your environment:\n+\n+| Worker Node OS | Run the following command\u2026                                                                           |\n+|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n+| EL\u00a06 (32-bit)  | `source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.3/current/el6-i386/setup.sh`   |\n+| EL\u00a06 (64-bit)  | `source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.3/current/el6-x86_64/setup.sh` |\n+| EL\u00a07 (64-bit)  | `source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.3/current/el7-x86_64/setup.sh` |\n+\n+Troubleshooting\n+---------------\n+\n+Some possible issues that may come up:\n+\n+- A missing softlink to the CA certs directory. To check this, run:\n+\n+        :::console\n+        [user@client ~] $ ls -l /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/osg-wn-client/3.3/current/el6-x86_64/etc/grid-security/\n+    \n+    and check that `certificates` is linked to somewhere. The fix is to yum update the `oasis-config` package to version 4 or higher. A known workaround is to run:\n+\n+        :::console\n+        [user@client ~] $ export X509_CERT_DIR=/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/certificates\n+    \n+    before any commands.\n+\n+How to get Help?\n+----------------\n+\n+To get assistance please use this [Help Procedure](../common/help.md).\n+\n+Reference\n+---------\n+\n+Please see the documentation on using [yum and RPM](../release/yum-basics.md), [the best practices](https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallBestPractices) for using yum to install software, and using [yum repositories](../common/yum.md).\n+\n+### Worker node contents\n+\n+The worker node may be updated from time to time. As of OSG 3.3.21 in February 2017, the OSG worker node client contains:\n+\n+-   OSG Certificates\n+-   curl\n+-   Fetch CRL\n+-   FTS client\n+-   gfal2\n+-   globus-url-copy (GridFTP client)\n+-   globus-xio-udt-driver\n+-   ldapsearch\n+-   MyProxy\n+-   osg-system-profiler\n+-   osg-version\n+-   UberFTP\n+-   vo-client (includes /etc/vomses file)\n+-   VOMS client\n+-   wget\n+-   xrdcp\n+\n+To see the currently installed version of the worker node package, run the following command:",
