All of the documentation can be found in the [Release3](https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/) area of the TWiki.\n+\n+Updating to the new release\n+---------------------------\n+\n+### Update Repositories\n+\n+To update to this series, you need [install the current OSG repositories](../../common/yum#install-osg-repositories).\n+\n+### Update Software\n+\n+Once the repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:\n+\n+``` console\n+root@host # yum update\n+```\n+\n+!!! note\n+    Please be aware that running `yum update` may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the `--exclude=[package-name or glob]` option for the `yum` command.\n+\n+!!! note\n+    Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a `.rpmnew` file being created. That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed. In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a `.rpmnew` extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the `.rpmnew` file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the `.rpmnew` extension). Watch especially for `/etc/lcmaps.db`, which every site is expected to edit.\n+\n+Need help?\n+----------\n+\n+Do you need help with this release? [Contact us for help](../../common/help).\n+\n+Detailed changes in this release\n+--------------------------------\n+\n+### Packages\n+\n+We added or updated the following packages to the production OSG yum repository.
