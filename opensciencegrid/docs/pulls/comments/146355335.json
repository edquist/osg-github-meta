The purpose of the document is to provide an overview about the different ways to setup an OSG site and to encourage you to plan your site before you continue to install the OSG software on your site.\n \n After reading this document you should be able to identify the site elements needed to setup your OSG site and choose among different technology choices presented.\n \n-## Background\n-\n-The goal for the Open Science Grid software stack is to provide a uniform computing and storage interface across many independently managed computing and storage clusters. Scientists, researchers, and students, organized as virtual organizations (VOs), are the consumers of the CPU cycles and storage.\n-\n-Your site is encouraged to support as many OSG-registered VOs as possible, but you are not required to support all of them.\n-\n-As the administrator responsible for deployment of the OSG software stack, your task is to make your existing computing and storage cluster available to and reliable for the VOs that you support. The OSG expects you to set up a gatekeeper node called a Compute Element (CE) on which the bulk of the OSG software gets installed. The end-user sends jobs into your cluster's batch system, your CE receives them and passes them out to Worker Nodes (WN) for execution. Some VOs and end-users require non-negligible amounts of data as input, or generate non-negligible amounts of data as output. They will need to store that data in a Storage Element (SE). A site is not required to provide both a CE and an SE.\n-\n-## Site Policies\n-\n-OSG expects you to clearly specify your site's policies regarding resource access. Please write them on a web page, make this page part of your site registration, and make it available via the GOC publishing tool [MyOSG](http://my.opensciencegrid.org) and the OSG information management system, OIM. We encourage you to allow all virtual organizations registered with the OSG at least \"opportunistic use\" of your resources. You may need to preempt those jobs when higher priority jobs come around. The end-users using the OSG generally prefer having access to your site subject to preemption over having no access at all.\n-\n-## OSG Site Elements\n-\n-The OSG provides software and documentation to install and operate following services:\n-\n-\n-| Element               | Description                                                                                |\n-|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n-| Authorization Service | enables grid users to authorize with your site using their grid or voms proxies            |\n-| Compute Element       | enables grid users to run jobs on your site                                                |\n-| Worker Node Client    | enables grid jobs running on worker nodes to access grid tools                             |\n-| Storage Element       | enables grid users to store large amounts of data at your site                             |\n-| VO Management Service | provides functionality for VO Managers to manage the membership information of their users |\n-\n-\n-### Authorization Service\n-\n-Grid users will authorization with your site using their **grid or voms proxy**. The OSG provides two different services that let you control the authorization process:\n-\n-| **Service**                     | **Description**                                                           | **Advantages**               | **Disadvantages**                          |\n-|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n-| edg-mkgridmap                   | a simple program that contacts VOMS servers and creates a gridmap file    | easy to install and maintain | does not support voms proxies              |\n-| [GUMS](security/install-gums)   | a web service providing sophisticated controls of how users authorization | supports voms proxies        | requires Tomcat to be run as a web service |\n-\n-\n-!!! warning\n-    A **VOMS Server** is not an element of your site. Each **Virtual Organization** operates a central VOMS Server to manage membership information of its grid users. Please contact the **VO Manager** for your virtual organization to obtain more details.\n+Background\n+----------\n \n-### Compute Element\n+The goal for the OSG Software stack is to provide a uniform computing and storage fabric across many\n+independently-managed computing and storage resources. These individual services will be accessed by virtual\n+organizations (VOs), which will delegate the resources to scientists, researchers, and students.\n \n-A **Compute Element** allows grid users to run jobs on your site. It is software that provides following services when run on your **gatekeeper**: The standard installation is based on HTCondor-CE with RSV for monitoring.\n+_Sharing_ is a fundamental principle for the OSG: your site is encouraged to support as many OSG-registered VOs as\n+local conditions allow.  _Autonomy_ is another principle: you are not required to support any you do not want.\n \n-You must determine your security policy with regard to Unix ID management on the cluster. You may choose group accounts and/or dynamic accounts for all users.\n+As the administrator responsible for deployment of the OSG software stack, your task is to make your existing computing\n+and storage resources available to and reliable for your support VOs.
