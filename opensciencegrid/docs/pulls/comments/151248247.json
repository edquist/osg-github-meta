Instead of sending the user's certificate with the job for this re-authentication, trust can be delegated to a proxy that is generated from the user certificate, which is then attached to the job and expires after some set time for added security.\n \n-In its default configuration, HTCondor-CE uses GSI-based authentication and authorization (the same as Globus GRAM) to verify the certificate chain, which will work with existing GUMS servers or grid mapfiles.
