Once software is installed into\n+an OASIS repository, the goal is to make it available across about 90% of the OSG within an hour.\n \n+OASIS consists of keysigning infrastructure, a content distribution network (CDN), and a shared CVMFS repository that\n+is hosted by the OSG.  Many use cases will be covered by utilizing the [shared repository](update-oasis); this document\n+covers how to install, configure, and host your own CVMFS _repository server_.  This server will distribute software\n+via OASIS, but be hosted and operated externally from the OSG project.\n ",
