When these users and hosts wish to communicate with each other, the identities of each party is confirmed by cross-checking their certificates with the signing CA and establishing trust.\n-\n-Due to the OSG's distributed nature, a user's job may end up at any number of sites, potentially needing to re-authenticate at multiple points. Instead of sending the user's certificate with the job for this re-authentication, trust can be delegated to a proxy that is generated from the user certificate, which is then attached to the job and expires after some set time for added security.\n+In the OSG, security depends on a PKI infrastructure involving Certificate Authorities (CAs) where CAs sign and issue certificates.
