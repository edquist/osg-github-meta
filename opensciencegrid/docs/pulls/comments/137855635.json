OSG recommends that sites install and run RSV, but it is optional; further, each site selects which specific tests (called *probes*) to run.\n+\n+Use this page to learn more about RSV in general, and how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot RSV from the OSG software repositories. For documentation on specific probes or on how to write your own probes, please check the [Reference section](#reference).\n+\n+Introduction to RSV\n+-------------------\n+\n+The Resource and Service Validation (RSV) software provides OSG site administrators a scalable and easy-to-maintain resource and service monitoring infrastructure. The components of RSV are:\n+\n+- **RSV Client.** The client tools allow a site administrator to run tests against their site by providing a set of tests (which can run on the same or other hosts within a site), HTCondor-Cron for scheduling, and tools for collecting and storing the results (using Gratia). The client package is not installed by default and may be installed on a CE or other host. Generally, you configure the RSV client to run tests at scheduled time intervals and then it makes results available on a local website. Also, the client can upload test results to a central collector (see next item).\n+- **RSV Collector/Server.** The central OSG RSV Collector accepts and stores results from RSV clients throughout OSG, which can be viewed in [MyOSG](http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/), on the \u201cCurrent RSV Status\u201d page and under the \u201cResource Group\u201d menu.\n+- **Periodic Availability Reports.** The availability of all active registered OSG resources and the services running on each of those resources is calculated using the results received for [critical metrics](https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/RsvEquivalency#Critical_Tests_for_OSG_Resources>). Once a day, these availability numbers are [published online](http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports) and via email [as explained here](https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/MeasurementsAndMetrics/RsvReportsOverview>) (More information: [Outline of reports](https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/RSVPeriodicReporting), [Installation guide for GOC staff](https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/MeasurementsAndMetrics/RsvReports)).\n+- **RSV-SAM Transport.** The WLCG RSV-SAM Transport infrastructure pushes out RSV results, for resources that are flagged to be part of the WLCG Interoperability agreement, from the GOC collector to WLCG's Service Availability Monitoring (SAM) system. More information on viewing these results is [available here](Operations.RsvSAMGridView).",
