There are many different variations on how to do that, but this document focuses on the configuration of the OSG GOC Stratum 1 oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org. It is applicable to other Stratum 1s as well, very likely with modifications (some of which are suggested in the document below).\n+\n+# Applicable versions \n+The applicable software versions for this document are cvmfs and cvmfs-server >= 2.2.1.\n+\n+# Requirements\n+\n+## Host and OS\n+\n+-   OS is a 64-bit <span class=\"twiki-macro SUPPORTED_OS\"></span>.\n+-   Root access\n+-   SELinux disabled\n+-   Adequate disk space for the repositories that will be served, at `/srv/cvmfs`. Do not use xfs as the filesystem type on operating systems older than RHEL7, because it has been demonstrated to perform poorly for CVMFS repositories; instead use ext3 or ext4. About 10GB should be reserved for apache and squid logs under /var/log on a production server, although they normally will not get that large. A Stratum 1 that is also a repository server should have at least 5GB available at `/var/cache`.\n+\n+## Users and Groups\n+\n+If your machine is also going to be a repository server like the OSG GOC, the installation will create one user unless it already exists:\n+\n+<span class=\"twiki-macro STARTSECTION\">Users</span>\n+\n+| User    | Comment                   |\n+|:--------|:--------------------------|\n+| `cvmfs` | CernVM-FS service account |\n+\n+<span class=\"twiki-macro ENDSECTION\">Users</span>\n+\n+A repository server installation will also create a cvmfs group and default the cvmfs user to that group.\n+\n+In addition, if the fuse rpm is not for some reason already installed, installing the repository server packages will also install fuse and that will create another group:\n+\n+<span class=\"twiki-macro STARTSECTION\">Groups</span>\n+\n+| Group   | Comment                   | Group members |\n+|:--------|:--------------------------|:--------------|\n+| `cvmfs` | CernVM-FS service account | none          |\n+| `fuse`  | FUSE service account      | `cvmfs`       |\n+\n+<span class=\"twiki-macro ENDSECTION\">Groups</span>\n+\n+# Install Instructions\n+\n+All CVMFS Stratum 1s require cvmfs-server software and apache (httpd). It is highly recommended to also install frontier-squid and frontier-awstats on the same machine to be able to easily join the WLCG [MRTG](http://wlcg-squid-monitor.cern.ch/snmpstats/indexcvmfs.html) and [awstats](http://wlcg-squid-monitor.cern.ch/awstats/cvmfs.html) monitoring systems. The recommended configuration for frontier-squid below does not do any caching, it is just for monitoring.\n+\n+## Installing cvmfs-server and httpd\n+\n+The OSG GOC Stratum 1 has to function as a repository server in addition to serving repository replications; most Stratum 1s serve only replications. Serving repositories is done quite differently on Redhat EL5 and EL6 systems. Instructions are also provided for how to install cvmfs-server on Stratum 1s that do not have to be repository servers, which is the same on both versions of operating systems. Choose one of the following three sections.\n+\n+### Installing a CVMFS repository server\n+\n+#### Installing CVMFS repository server on RHEL5\n+\n+Redhat EL5-based systems that are not Scientific Linux-based should first build the [SL5 aufs source rpm](http://ftp.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/5x/SRPMS/SL/aufs-0.20090202.cvs-6.sl5.src.rpm) and install the resulting rpm in their own yum repository.\n+\n+Follow these instructions to install:\n+\n+```\n+[root@client ~] $ rpm -i http://cvmrepo.web.cern.ch/cvmrepo/yum/cvmfs/EL/5/x86_64/cvmfs-release-2-4.el5.noarch.rpm",
