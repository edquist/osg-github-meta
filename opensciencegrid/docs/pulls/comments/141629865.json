There are many different variations on how to do that, but this document focuses on the configuration of the OSG GOC Stratum 1 oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org. It is applicable to other Stratum 1s as well, very likely with modifications (some of which are suggested in the document below).\n+\n+# Applicable versions \n+The applicable software versions for this document are cvmfs and cvmfs-server >= 2.2.1.\n+\n+# Requirements\n+\n+## Host and OS\n+\n+-   OS is a 64-bit <span class=\"twiki-macro SUPPORTED_OS\"></span>.\n+-   Root access\n+-   SELinux disabled\n+-   Adequate disk space for the repositories that will be served, at `/srv/cvmfs`. Do not use xfs as the filesystem type on operating systems older than RHEL7, because it has been demonstrated to perform poorly for CVMFS repositories; instead use ext3 or ext4. About 10GB should be reserved for apache and squid logs under /var/log on a production server, although they normally will not get that large. A Stratum 1 that is also a repository server should have at least 5GB available at `/var/cache`.\n+\n+## Users and Groups\n+\n+If your machine is also going to be a repository server like the OSG GOC, the installation will create one user unless it already exists:\n+\n+<span class=\"twiki-macro STARTSECTION\">Users</span>",
