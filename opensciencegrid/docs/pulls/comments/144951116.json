Everything stops and waits on CVMFS.\r\n- The RHEL7 default script includes: `It is highly advisable to create own systemd services or udev rules to run scripts during boot instead of using this file.`\r\n\r\nIt's just not the proper way of doing things anymore... we should contact upstream CVMFS about this advice too.\r\n\r\nFix it if it's easy, but I'm not going to hold up the PR for it.",

The requirements for a CVMFS repository server are that it have installed cvmfs-server and cvmfs client, both version 2.2.2 or greater; version 2.3.3 or greater is recommended on EL6 and required on EL7. This requires using aufs or OverlayFS: aufs requires a modified kernel from CERN for Redhat EL6-based systems, and OverlayFS requires at least EL7.3; the latter uses a standard kernel so it is highly recommended. Also an apache httpd server needs to be enabled.

In addition, on EL7.3 and cvmfs-server-2.3.3 or 2.3.5, `/var/spool/cvmfs` needs to be of filesystem type 'ext4' or the `cvmfs_server` command will not allow it. There is a variable to override the filesystem type check, but other filesystem types are not guaranteed to work (ext3 and xfs created with `ftype=1` should work with `CVMFS_DONT_CHECK_OVERLAYFS_VERSION=yes`).\n+`/srv/cvmfs` will hold all the published data, so make sure it is large enough to hold all the repositories hosted on the machine. `/var/spool/cvmfs` will hold files during publish, so it should be large enough to hold the most amount of data that might be attempted to be published at once.
