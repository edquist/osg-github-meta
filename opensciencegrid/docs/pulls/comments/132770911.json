For example, the 3.2 release series contains OSG software 3.2.0, 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and so forth. A release series corresponds to a set of Yum software repositories, including ones for development, testing, and production use. The Yum repositories for one release series are completely distinct from the repositories for a different release series, even though they share many common packages.  A particular release within a series is a snapshot of packages and their exact versions at one point in time. When you install software from a release series, say 3.2, you get the most current versions of software packages within that series, regardless of the current release version.\n+\n+When a new series is released, it is an opportunity for the OSG Technology area to add major new software packages, make substantial updates to existing packages, and remove obsolete packages. When a new series is initially released, most packages are identical to the previous release, but two adjacent series will diverge over time.\n+\n+Our goal is, within a series, that one may upgrade their OSG services via `yum update` cleanly and without any necessary config file changes or excessive downtime.\n+\n+OSG Release Series\n+==================\n+\n+Since the start of the RPM-based OSG software stack, we have offered the following release series:\n+\n+-   **OSG 3.1** started in April 2012, and was end-of-lifed in April 2015. While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. Historically, there were 3.0.x releases as well, but there was no separate release series for 3.0 and 3.1; we simply went from 3.0.10 to 3.1.0 in the same repositories.\n+\n+-   **OSG 3.2** started in November 2013, and was end-of-lifed in August 2016. While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. The main differences between it and 3.1 were the introduction of glideinWMS 3.2, HTCondor 8.0, and Hadoop/HDFS 2.0; also the gLite CE Monitor system was dropped in favor of osg-info-services.\n+\n+-   **OSG 3.3** started in August 2015 and is still supported today.  End-of-support is scheduled for June 2018; sites are encouraged to investigate the upgrade to OSG 3.4. The main differences between 3.3 and 3.2 are the dropping of EL5 support, the addition of EL7 support, and the dropping of Globus GRAM support.\n+\n+-   **OSG 3.4** stared June 2017. The main differences between it and 3.3 are the removal of edg-mkgridmap, GUMS, BeStMan, and VOMS Admin Server packages.\n+\n+OSG Upcoming\n+============\n+\n+There is one more OSG Series called \"upcoming\" which contains major updates planned for a future release series. The yum repositories for upcoming (`osg-upcoming` and `osg-upcoming-testing`) are available from all OSG 3.x series, and individual packages can be installed from Upcoming without needing to update entirely to a new series. Note, however, that packages in the \"upcoming\" repositories are tested against the most recent OSG series.  As of the time of writing, `osg-upcoming` is meant to work with OSG 3.4.\n+\n+Installing an OSG Release Series\n+================================\n+\n+See the [yum repositories document](/common/yum) for instructions on installing the OSG repositories.\n+\n+Updating from OSG 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 to 3.3 or 3.4\n+=============================================\n+\n+1.  If you have an existing installation based on OSG 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3 (which will be referred to as the *old series*), and want to upgrade to 3.3 or 3.4 (the *new series*), we recommend the following procedure:\n+\n+    First, remove the old series yum repositories:\n+\n+        :::console\n+        [root@client ~] # rpm -e osg-release\n+\n+    This step ensures that any local modifications to `*.repo` files will not prevent installing the new series repos. Any modified `*.repo` files should appear under `/etc/yum.repos.d/` with the `*.rpmsave` extension. After installing the new OSG repositories (the next step) you may want to apply any changes made in the `*.rpmsave` files to the new `*.repo` files.\n+\n+2.  Install the OSG repositories:\n+\n+        :::console\n+        [root@client ~] # rpm -Uvh <URL>\n+\n+    where `<URL>` is one of the following:\n+\n+    | Series                    | EL5 URL (for RHEL5, CentOS5, or SL5)                             | EL6 URL (for RHEL6, CentOS6, or SL6)                             | EL7 URL (for RHEL7, CentOS7, or SL7)                             |\n+    |:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n+    | **OSG 3.1** (unsupported) | `http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el5-release-latest.rpm` | `http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el6-release-latest.rpm` | N/A                                                              |\n+    | **OSG 3.2** (unsupported) | `http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el5-release-latest.rpm` | `http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el6-release-latest.rpm` | N/A                                                              |\n+    | **OSG 3.3**               | N/A                                                              | `http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.3/osg-3.3-el6-release-latest.rpm` | `http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.3/osg-3.3-el7-release-latest.rpm` |\n+    | **OSG 3.4**               | N/A                                                              | `http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el6-release-latest.rpm` | `http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el7-release-latest.rpm` |\n+\n+3.
