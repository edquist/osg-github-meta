They complement the [OIM Web Interface](https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificateuser).\n+\n+Prerequisites\n+-------------\n+\n+If you have not already done so, you need to [configure the OSG software repositories](../common/yum.md).\n+\n+Installation\n+------------\n+\n+The command-line scripts have been packaged as an RPM and are available from the OSG repositories.\n+\n+To install the RPM, run:\n+\n+```console\n+[root@client ~] # yum install osg-pki-tools\n+```\n+\n+Usage\n+-----\n+\n+### Configuration Files\n+\n+This configuration file contains information divided into two sections for testing and production.  Configuration variables include:\n+\n+-   Request URL\n+-   Approve URL\n+-   Retrieve URL\n+-   Host URL\n+\n+These parameters are used as input to the script depending upon the mode of execution of the script (test or OIM). The command-line utilities check for configuration files in the following order:\n+\n+-   `$HOME/.osg-pki/OSG_PKI.ini`\n+-   `./pki-clients.ini`\n+-   `/etc/pki-clients.ini`\n+\n+### osg-cert-request\n+\n+Sends a request for a host certificate.\n+\n+This script generates a private key and submits a request for a certificate to the OSG PKI. The request will be approved by an appropriate Grid Admin. You will receive an email when this approval has been completed containing directions on how to run `osg-cert-retreive` to retrieve the certificate. It works in two modes:\n+\n+-   CSR is provided by the user: the CSR provided is sent to the OIM.\n+-   CSR is not provided by the user: the script generates a private key for the user. Writes it to default key file name or the one specified by `-o`.\n+\n+This script:\n+\n+-   Generates a new host private key and CSR (the only important part of CSR is `CN=<HOSTNAME>` component).\n+-   Saves the host private key to disk (as specified by the user).\n+-   Authenticates to OIM and posts the CSR as a request to OIM.\n+-   Returns the request ID to the user.\n+\n+If the user provides the CSR, then this script would just send the same CSR to OIM.\n+\n+**Inputs:**\n+\n+-   fully-qualified hostname\n+-   filename to store private key (optional; default is `./hostkey.pem`).\n+-   path to user's certificate (optional: default is path specified by `$X509_USER_CERT` environment variable, then `~/.globus/usercert.pem`).\n+-   path to user's private key (optional: default is path specified by `$X509_USER_KEY` environment variable, then `~/.globus/userkey.pem`).\n+-   Passphrase for user's private key (via non-echoing prompt).\n+-   User needs to provide VO name if the requested hostname has multiple VO's assigned.\n+\n+**Outputs:**\n+\n+-   Private key, to filename specified by `-o` or `./hostkey.pem` by default.\n+-   Request Id, to `stdout`.\n+\n+```console\n+[root@client ~] # osg-cert-request --help\n+Usage: osg-cert-request [options]\n+\n+Options:\n+  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n+  -c CSR, --csr=CSR     Specify CSR name (default = gennew.csr)\n+  -o OUTPUT KEYFILE, --outkeyfile=OUTPUT KEYFILE\n+                        Specify the output filename for the retrieved user certificate.\n+                        Default is ./hostkey.pem\n+  -v VO name, --vo=VO name\n+                        Specify the VO for the host request\n+  -y CC LIST, --cc=CC LIST\n+                        Specify the CC list(the email id's to be CCed).\n+                        Separate values by ','\n+  -m COMMENT, --comment=COMMENT\n+                        The comment to be added to the request\n+  -H CN, --hostname=CN  Specify a hostname for CSR (FQDN)\n+  -a HOSTNAME, --altname=HOSTNAME\n+                        Specify an alternative hostname for the CSR (FQDN).
