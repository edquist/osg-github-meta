It assumes you understand [YUM/RPM Basics](../common/).\n+\n+\n+\n+Install yum-priorities\n+----------------------\n+\n+We use `yum` priorities to ensure that we get the right packages from the OSG repositories. Please install it:\n+\n+``` screen\n+%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install yum-priorities\n+```\n+\n+There is [good documentation](http://wiki.centos.org/PackageManagement/Yum/Priorities) in the wild about yum priorities, but we'll summarize the essential bits for you.\n+\n+The basic idea of yum priorities is that if a package is found in two repositories, priorities will influence how yum chooses which package to install. We want the OSG software repository to be chosen instead of the EPEL repository so software, such as Globus, comes from our repository instead of the EPEL repository. (This is important because you will have installation errors if you get the EPEL Globus.)\n+\n+Yum priorities is a *yum plugin*. Once enabled, you can set the priority of each repository (located in /etc/yum.repos.d) The lower the numerical priority, the better the priority. The default priority for a repository when it's not specified is 99. We set the priority for the OSG repository to be 98, as you can see here:\n+\n+``` screen\n+% cat /etc/yum.repos.d/osg.repo\n+[osg]\n+name=OSG Software for Enterprise Linux 5 - $basearch\n+mirrorlist=http://repo.grid.iu.edu/mirror/osg-release/$basearch\n+failovermethod=priority\n+priority=%RED%98%ENDCOLOR%\n+enabled=0\n+gpgcheck=1\n+gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG\n+```\n+\n+You can adjust these priorities if you have special needs at your site.\n+\n+Automatic Updates\n+-----------------\n+\n+We strongly recommend against automatic updates for production services. You want to only change software versions during a controlled downtime (or, at least, while a human is watching); we strive to thoroughly test software updates, but cannot guarantee new version of software will not be problematic for your site.\n+\n+For testbeds, automatic updates are suggested\n+\n+Troubleshooting\n+---------------\n+\n+Sometimes when installing, you will get an error like this:\n+\n+``` screen\n+http://ftp1.scientificlinux.org/linux/scientific/54/x86_64/updates/security/repodata/filelists.sqlite.bz2: %RED%[Errno -1] Metadata file does not match checksum%ENDCOLOR%\n+```\n+\n+This often indicates that you have out of date information, cached by `yum`. The following command will clear the out of date information, and you can try again:\n+\n+``` screen",
