This guide details installing Hadoop 2.0 from the OSG 3.2 repositories.\n+\n+Preparation\n+===========\n+\n+Introduction\n+------------\n+\n+[Hadoop Distributed File System](http://hadoop.apache.org/hdfs/) (HDFS) is a scalable reliable distributed file system developed in the Apache project. It is based on map-reduce framework and design of the Google file system. The VDT distribution of Hadoop includes all components needed to operate a multi-terabyte storage site. Included are:\n+\n+-   An [SRM interface](https://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/doc/SRM.v2.2.html) for grid access;\n+-   GridFTP-HDFS as transport layer; and\n+-   A [FUSE interface](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) for localized POSIX access.\n+-   [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/)\n+\n+The OSG packaging and distribution of Hadoop is based on YUM. All components are packaged as RPMs and are available from the OSG repositories. It is also recommended that you enable [EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repos.\n+\n+Note on upgrading from Hadoop 0.20",
