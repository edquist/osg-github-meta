Configure it using the following steps.\n+\n+Modify **`/etc/fstab`** by adding the following entries:\n+\n+    :::file\n+    ....\n+    xrootdfs                %RED%/mnt/xrootd%ENDCOLOR%              fuse    rdr=xroot://%RED%redirector1.domain.com%ENDCOLOR%:1094/%RED%/path/%ENDCOLOR%,uid=xrootd 0 0\n+\n+\n+Replace `/mnt/xrootd` with the path that you would like to access with. This should also match the GridFTP settings for the `XROOTD_VMP` local path. Create **`/mnt/xrootd`** directory. Once you are finished, you can mount it:\n+\n+    :::file\n+    mount /mnt/xrootd\n+\n+You should now be able to run UNIX commands such as `ls /mnt/xrootd` to see the contents of the XRootD server.\n+\n ### (Optional) Authorization\n \n There are several authorization options in XRootD available through the security\n plugins. In this document, we will cover two options for security:\n \n -   Simple Unix Security: Based on user accounts that the client is logged in as.\n--   xrootd-lcmaps: Using the lcmaps callout to use GUMS authorization\n+-   Shared-key based authentication.\n+-   `xrootd-lcmaps`: Using the LCMAPS callout to use X509-based authentication",
