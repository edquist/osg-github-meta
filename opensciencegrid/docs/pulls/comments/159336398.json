It **does not** cover anything but the simplest possible install.

Pilots submitted by the factory will join to one of these collectors to form a Condor pool.\n -   **User Pool Schedd**: A `condor_schedd`. Users may submit Condor vanilla universe jobs to this schedd; it will run jobs in the Condor pool formed by the **User Pool Collectors**.\n -   **Glidein Frontend**: The frontend will periodically query the **User Pool Schedd** to determine the desired number of running job slots. If necessary, it will request the factory to launch additional pilots.\n \n-This guide covers installation of all three components on the same host: it is designed for small to medium VOs (see the Hardware Requirements below). Given a significant, large host, we have been able to scale the single-host install to 20,000 running jobs.\n-\n-![alt text](../images/simple_diagram.png)\n-\n-\n-Release\n-=======\n+This guide covers installation of all three components on the same host: it is\n+designed for small to medium VOs (see the Hardware Requirements below). Given a\n+significant, large host, we have been able to scale the single-host install to\n+20,000 running jobs.\n \n-This document reflects glideinWMS v3.2.17.\n-\n-How to get Help?\n-================\n-\n-To get assistance about the OSG software please use [this page](../common/help.md).\n-\n-For specific questions about the Frontend configuration (and how to add it in your HTCondor infrastructure) you can email the glideinWMS support <glideinwms-support@fnal.gov>\n+![GlideinWMS Architecture](/images/simple_diagram.png)\n \n-To request access the OSG Glidein Factory (e.g. the UCSD factory) you have to send an email to <osg-gfactory-support@physics.ucsd.edu> (see below).\n \n-Requirements\n-============\n+Before Starting\n+---------------\n \n-Host and OS\n------------\n+Before starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting [the Reference section below](#reference) as needed):\n \n-1. A host to install the GlideinWMS Frontend (pristine node).\n-2. OS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and variants (see [details](../common/yum.md)). Currently most of our testing has been done on Scientific Linux 6.\n-3. Root access\n+-   **User IDs:** If they do not exist already, the installation will create the Linux users `apache` (UID 48), `condor`, `frontend`, and `gratia`\n+-   **Network:** The VO frontend must have reliable network connectivity, be on the public internet (no NAT), and preferably with no firewalls. Each running pilot requires 5 outgoing TCP ports. Incoming TCP ports 9618 to 9660 must be open.",
