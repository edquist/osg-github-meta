A VO representative who will have responsibility for the contents of the repository chooses a name for the repository. This name should be the name of the VO or be derived from it (or a project in the VO for the case of the OSG VO), and in a domain that has a secured master key. The recommended domain name for a new repository that originates at an OSG site is opensciencegrid.org. The full name used as an example in this document is **repo.domain.name**. Note: the VO representative's name will be registered in OIM as an OASIS manager for the VO, and names can be added or changed later with GOC tickets. If there is more than one repository for the VO, all the OASIS managers are assumed to be contacts for all the repositories.\n+Prior to creation, the repository administrator will need to make two decisions:\n \n-2.  Using whatever mechanism is appropriate at their institution, the VO representative requests the local CVMFS repository service administrator to create this repository called `repo.domain.name`.\n+-   **Select a repository name**; typically, this is derived from the VO or project's name and ends in\n+    `opensciencegrid.org`.  For example, the NoVA VO runs the repository `nova.opensciencegrid.org`.  For this section,\n+    we will use %RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%.\n+-   **Select a repository owner**: Software publication will need to run by a non-`root` Unix user account; for this\n+    document, we will use %BLUE%LIBRARIAN%ENDCOLOR% as the account name of the repository owner.\n \n-3.  The repository service administrator creates the repository with these command like these, where ownerid is the user id that will have write access:\n+The initial repository creation must be run as `root`:\n \n-        :::console\n-        root@host # echo -e \"\\*\\\\t\\\\t-\\\\tnofile\\\\t\\\\t16384\" >>/etc/security/limits.conf \n-        root@host # ulimit -n 16384 \n-        root@host # cvmfs_server mkfs -o ownerid repo.domain.name \n-        root@host # echo \"CVMFS_AUTO_TAG=false\" >>/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/repo.domain.name/server.conf \n-        root@host # (echo Order deny,allow;echo Deny from all;echo Allow from 127.0.0.1;echo Allow from ::1;echo Allow from 129.79.53.0/24;echo Allow from 2001:18e8:2:6::/56) >/srv/cvmfs/repo.domain.name/.htaccess\n+    :::console\n+    root@host # echo -e \"\\*\\\\t\\\\t-\\\\tnofile\\\\t\\\\t16384\" >>/etc/security/limits.conf\n+    root@host # ulimit -n 16384\n+    root@host # cvmfs_server mkfs -o %BLUE%LIBRARIAN%ENDCOLOR% %RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%\n+    root@host # echo \"CVMFS_AUTO_TAG=false\" >>/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/%RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%/server.conf\n+    root@host # (echo Order deny,allow;echo Deny from all;echo Allow from 127.0.0.1;echo Allow from ::1;echo Allow from 129.79.53.0/24;echo Allow from 2001:18e8:2:6::/56) >/srv/cvmfs/%RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%/.htaccess\n+\n+Here, we increase the number of open files, create the repository using the `mkfs` command, adjust the configuration,\n+and then limit the hosts that are allowed to access the repo to the OSG CDN.\n \n-    If you might be hosting any hardlinks that span directories (e.g. the git package) and are using aufs (that is, EL6), also do the following:\n+!!! note\n+    If you might be hosting any hardlinks that span directories (e.g. publishing a `git` repository) and are using\n+    EL6 with aufs, make the following configuration change:\n \n         :::console\n         root@host # echo \"CVMFS_IGNORE_XDIR_HARDLINKS=true\" >>/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/repo.domain.name/server.conf\n \n-    Verify that the repository is readable over http with the following command:\n+Verify that the repository is readable over HTTP:\n \n-        :::console\n-        root@host # wget -qO- http://localhost:8000/cvmfs/repo.domain.name/.cvmfswhitelist|cat -v\n+    :::console\n+    root@host # wget -qO- http://localhost:8000/cvmfs/%RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%/.cvmfswhitelist | cat -v\n+\n+That should print several lines including some gibberish at the end.\n+\n+Host a Repository on OASIS\n+------------------------\n \n-    That should print several lines including some gibberish at the end.\n+1.  **Verify your VO's OIM registration is up-to-date**.  All repositories need to be associated with a VO; the VO needs\n+    to make sure an appropriate individual has the _OASIS manager_ role in OIM.  This individual will be responsible\n+    for the contents of any of the VO's repositories and will be contacted in case of issues.\n \n-4.  The repository service administrator next creates a [GOC ticket](https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/goc/submit) using the following format:\n+2.  The repository administrator should **create a [support ticket](https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/goc/submit)**\n+    using the following template:\n \n-        Please add a new CVMFS repository to OASIS for VO voname using the URL \n-            http://fully.qualified.domain:8000/cvmfs/repo.domain.name \n-        by doing step #5 at\n+        Please add a new CVMFS repository to OASIS for VO %RED%voname%ENDCOLOR% using the URL \n+            http://%RED%fully.qualified.domain%ENDCOLOR%:8000/cvmfs/%RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%\n+        by doing step #3 at\n             https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/data/external-oasis-repos\n-        The VO responsible manager will be Vorep Name.\n+        The VO responsible manager will be %RED%OASIS Manager Name%ENDCOLOR%.\n \n-    replacing \"voname\" with the VO's name, \"fully.qualified.domain\" with the full name of the repository server, \"repo.domain.name\" with the full name of the repository, and \"Vorep Name\" with the name of the VO representative.\n+    Replace the %RED%red%ENDCOLOR% items with the appropriate values.\n \n-5.  The GOC representative next ensures that the repository service administrator is a valid representative of a host site for the VO. This can be done by (a) the GOC representative already having a relationship with the person or (b) the GOC representative contacting the VO manager to find out. The GOC representative makes sure that the repo.domain.name in the URL is derived from the VO name. \n+3.  (**OSG internal step**)\n+    OSG Operations ensures that the repository administrator is valid for the VO. This can be done by (a) OSG\n+    already having a relationship with the person or (b) the GOC representative contacting the VO manager to find out.\n+    OSG Operations should review the URL to verify it is appropriate for the VO.  This typically takes one business day.\n \n-6.  The GOC representative then adds the URL in OIM under OASIS Repo URLs for the VO. The repository will then be added to the GOC stratum 0 within 15 minutes.  Within an hour after step 8 is completed, the repository should also be automatically added to the GOC and FNAL stratum 1s.\n+4.  (**OSG internal step**)\n+    The OSG representative adds the repository URL in OIM under the VO's OASIS repository URLs. This should cause\n+    the repository's configuration to be added to the GOC Stratum-0 within 15 minutes.  Within an hour step 8 is\n+    completed, the repository should also be automatically added to the GOC and FNAL stratum 1s.\n \n-7.  If domain.name is a new domain that has not been distributed before, the GOC representative next places a copy of the domain.name.pub public key from domain.name into /srv/etc/keys on both oasis-replica and oasis-replica-itb. If the GOC representative does not have that key, he or she can ask the repository service representative in the ticket how to get it. In addition, in order to support cvmfs client versions 2.2.X (both older and newer clients do not need it), a symbolic link of `domain.name`.conf has to be made in /cvmfs/config-osg.opensciencegrid.org/etc/cvmfs/domain.d pointing to default.conf. This symbolic link has to be created on the oasis-itb machine's copy of the config-osg.opensciencegrid.org repository and then copied to production with the `copy_config_osg` command on the oasis machine.\n+5.  (**OSG internal step**): If the respository ends in a new\n+    domain name that has not been distributed before, the OSG representative next places a copy of the `domain.name.pub`\n+    public key from `domain.name` into `/srv/etc/keys` on both `oasis-replica` and `oasis-replica-itb`. If the OSG\n+    representative does not have that key, he or she will ask the repository service representative how to obtain it.\n+    In order to support CVMFS client versions 2.2.X, a symbolic link of `domain.name.conf` has to be made in\n+    `/cvmfs/config-osg.opensciencegrid.org/etc/cvmfs/domain.d` pointing to `default.conf`. This symbolic link has to be\n+    created on the `oasis-itb` machine's copy of the `config-osg.opensciencegrid.org` repository and then copied to\n+    production with the `copy_config_osg` command on the oasis machine.",
