After submission, HTCondor-CE monitors the batch system job and communicates its status to the original grid job, which in turn notifies the original submitter (e.g., job factory) of any updates. When the job completes, files are transferred along the same chain: from the batch system to the CE, then from the CE to the original submitter.\n \n+### Over SSH",
