The primary contributor (and largest user) is Yahoo. HDFS is based on the design of the Google File System. HDFS's strengths is in its ability to use commodity hard drives in worker nodes; it can turn a large amount of semi-reliable hardware into a system which is very reliable.\n+\n+To find out more information about HDFS, [visit its home page](http://hadoop.apache.org/hdfs/). If you are thinking about installing Hadoop, we also recommend reading the [HDFS architecture page](http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/hdfs_design.html).\n+\n+This page covers the OSG's usage of Hadoop, and includes instructions for installing a grid-enabled HDFS system.\n+\n+Planning\n+--------\n+\n+-   [HadoopUnderstanding](https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/HadoopUnderstanding): This document explains the various components for Hadoop and the recommended specifications of size and deployment.\n+\n+Installation\n+------------\n+\n+-   [Install Guide](install-hadoop-2-0-0)\n+    -   Change link <https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/ProbeInstallation>\n+    -   <https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationGratiaSiteCollector> revisit this link",
