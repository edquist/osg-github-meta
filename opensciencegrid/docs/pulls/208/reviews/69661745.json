There's a weird policy proclamation at the top (not matching any other site admin document in this web) and it's a mixture of directions for the site admin and GOC operational staff.\r\n\r\nWe should really keep the documentation for the non-OSG entity here and maybe keep the external stuff in the technology web.\r\n\r\nRegardless, once we fix up the minor stuff, we can do the separation later.",
