This means that requests to create, rename, remove, or blanking OASIS repositories will come in as GOC tickets. This document contains instructions for handling those tickets.\n+\n+!!! note \"Also see\"\n+    * [Policy for OSG Mirroring of External CVMFS repositories](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/technology/policy/external-oasis-repos/)\n+    * [External OASIS repository](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/docs/data/external-oasis-repos/)\n+\n+Hosting a repository on OASIS\n+-----------------------------\n+\n+1.  Ensure that the repository administrator is valid for the VO. This can be done by (a) OSG already having a\n+    relationship with the person or (b) the contacting the VO manager to find out.  Review the URL and verify verify\n+    that it is appropriate for the VO.\n+\n+1.  Add the repository URL in OIM under the VO's OASIS repository URLs. This should cause the repository's configuration\n+    to be added to the GOC Stratum-0 within 15 minutes.\n+\n+1.  If the respository ends in a new domain name that has not been distributed before, place a copy of the\n+    `domain.name.pub` public key from `domain.name` into `/srv/etc/keys` on both `oasis-replica` and\n+    `oasis-replica-itb`. If you do not have that key, ask the repository service representative how to obtain it.  In\n+    order to support CVMFS client versions 2.2.X, a symbolic link of `domain.name.conf` has to be made in\n+    `/cvmfs/config-osg.opensciencegrid.org/etc/cvmfs/domain.d` pointing to `default.conf`. This symbolic link has to be\n+    created on the `oasis-itb` machine's copy of the `config-osg.opensciencegrid.org` repository and then copied to\n+    production with the `copy_config_osg` command on the oasis machine.\n+\n+1.  If the repository name matches `*.opensciencegrid.org` or `*.osgstorage.org`, respond to the ticket to ask the\n+    administrator to continue with the next step; all other repositories (such as `*.egi.eu`) you are done.\n+\n+1.  Once the repository administrator has responded to the ticket, indicating that the BNL stratum 1 needs to be\n+    updated, ask the administrator of the BNL stratum 1 to also add the new repository.  The BNL Stratum-1 operator\n+    should set the service to read from\n+    `http://oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org:8000/cvmfs/%RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%`.  When the BNL\n+    Stratum-1 operator has reported back that the replication is ready, respond to the ticket that the repository is\n+    fully replicated on the OSG and close the ticket.\n+\n+Changing the URL of an external repository\n+------------------------------------------\n+\n+*Insert internal instructions here*\n+\n+Removing an external repository\n+-------------------------------\n+\n+1.  After validating that the ticket submitter is authorized by the VO's OASIS manager, the delete the registered value\n+    for %RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR% in OIM for the VO in OASIS Repo URLs.\n+1.  Add the FNAL and BNL Stratum-1 operators to the ticket to asks them to remove the repository.  Wait for the\n+    Stratum-1 operators to finish before proceeding.\n+1.  Run `cvmfs_server rmfs -f %RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%` and `rm -r\n+    /oasissrv/cvmfs/%RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%` on `oasis-replica-itb` and `oasis-replica`\n+1.  Run the following command on `oasis-itb` and `oasis`:\n+\n+        :::console\n+        rm -r /srv/cvmfs/%RED%example.opensciencegrid.org%ENDCOLOR%\n+\n+Blanking an externally-hosted repostiroy\n+----------------------------------------\n+\n+1.
