  "body": "I just read through the whole RabbitMQ SLA and left a PR with some corrections and suggestions. But I have broader questions and comments, without suggested changes, so on @brianhlin\u2019s advice I am putting them here.\r\n\r\nNow, to be fair, I suspect that this particular SLA is mostly copy-and-paste from other IU-Ops SLAs, and many of my comments are likely to apply equally well elsewhere. So quite possibly, the response to many or all of my comments will be \u201cbut that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done it\u201d. So be it.\r\n\r\n- The Version Control information is not, IMO, so interesting that it belongs at the top of the document. In fact, I would move it to the very end.\r\n\r\n- The Executive Summary summarizes the service, which is helpful \u2013 it sets the stage for understanding the rest of the document. But I think that there are two glaring omissions: (1) There is no statement of how this service fits into the overall OSG system of services; in other words, how can I understand the effect of issues with this service if I have no idea how it relates to others? (2) There is no summary of the level of service itself \u2014\u00a0for that, I have to read almost the entire document.\r\n\r\n- I find the presentation of the \u201cService Target Response Priorities and Response Times\u201d table to be nearly incomprehensible. I\u2019m not sure exactly how to improve, but I think that I would start by swapping axes, so that level of criticality was the vertical axis, from Critical to Normal, and the columns were for Description, Response Time, etc.\r\n\r\n- Under \u201cRequests for Service Enhancements\u201d, I find this statement to be curious: \u201cIU-OPS has sole discretion as to their implementation and deployment schedule\u201d. Does that mean that, say, if the Executive Director asks for a service change to be implemented within a certain timeframe, that IU-Ops can just say no?\r\n\r\n- I think that the combination of statements in \u201cSLA Validity Period\u201d and \u201cSLA Review Procedure\u201d render the validity period moot. Why not just say that the SLA is in effect until changed or dropped, as guided by various key folks?",
