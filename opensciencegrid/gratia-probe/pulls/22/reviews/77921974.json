  "body": "Hi @retzkek,\r\n\r\nThe final tree for this PR looks fine, but I would prefer this be done as a real (non-squash) merge, which includes the history from the existing `aws` branch.  (You can do this either by merging `master` into your `aws` branch or making a new branch off of `master` and merging `aws` into it.)\r\n\r\n[EDIT: nevermind about the `python2-boto3` dependency, I see now it was added, not removed.  I was viewing a reversed diff  :-p]",
