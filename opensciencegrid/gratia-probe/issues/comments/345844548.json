  "body": "As for `python2-boto3` not being available for el6 - it means that yum will fail/refuse to install the probe on el6, even if perhaps they have made boto3 available with pip. ... So... I guess I see the options being:\r\n1. drop the `python2-boto3` requirement altogether and expect people to install via pip\r\n2. make the `python2-boto3` requirement conditional for el7 (`%if 0%{?rhel} >= 7 `), and expect people to install via pip on el6\r\n3. convince @brianhlin that we should package `python2-boto3` in osg for el6  ;)\r\n4. expect/accept that nobody will use this probe on el6\r\n\r\n(To me, 1 or 2 makes the most sense, but I'm not sure what the expected usage is like...)\r\n\r\n... As for the merge vs squash thing, in general I think it's nice to have the history context to see how changes were introduced if anything needs to be investigated later, and for git blame to tell the right story. Plus then the dev branch shows up as merged. ... But if you feel strongly about discarding the history I won't put up any further resistance  ;)",
