But at least it documents that we need it explicitly.\r\n\r\n> No specific reasons. Just the normal ones. \"Old installations\", \"condor installed not with RPM\"...\r\n\r\nHopefully this new requirement will not break old installations too badly...  (If they are updating to the new gratia-probe, they'll probably be updating to newer condor too?)\r\n\r\n> I've changed the membership check from using `if x in classad` to `classad[x]`\r\n\r\nDo we need to be concerned about the cases where `classad[x]` is `0` or `\"\"` ?",
