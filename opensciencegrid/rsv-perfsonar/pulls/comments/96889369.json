  "body": "This looks like significant increase, does it determine time-range for getting the results if regular activity failed ? Asking for such time range could have heavy impact on the workload of the toolkits - I suggest we don't go beyond 48 hours. If we need to fill a large missing time window, we might need to introduce some interleave between queries - maybe startup another collector instance that would perform \"regular\" collection over fixed time window.",
