  "body": "This change proposes that we split publishing of summaries and raw data, into two different topics (perfsonar.raw.<even-type> and perfsonar.summary.<event-type>). Summary messages will only contain aggregations/statistics while raw messages will only contain data points. This change will require full re-configuration of the brokers since new topics have to be introduced, but should be relatively transparent for consumers (they just change to a new topic).\n",
