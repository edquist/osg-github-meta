  "body": "I recommend changing the block type from `console` to `bash` if you're going to do this, which should improve the syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're going to do copy-and-paste, consider making the user define shell variables and using them in the code block. That is, at the top have a section that says\r\n> Set the following shell variables:\r\n> ```\r\n> VERSIONS=\"<VERSION(S)>\"\r\n> REVISION=<REVISION>\r\n> ```\r\nAnd change the code blocks to say, e.g.:\r\n> ```\r\n> 2-create-release -d $REVISION $VERSIONS\r\n> ```\r\nYour choice, though it worked for me in https://opensciencegrid.github.io/technology/infrastructure/koji-restore-recipe/",
