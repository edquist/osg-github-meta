I would be reluctant to require them to understand the internal structure of the OSG to figure out what we, as the entire project, are providing.\n\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t NACK a follow-on PR along the lines of what\u2019s in the thread here.  I didn\u2019t see anything controversial in Scott\u2019s original suggestion - can you just resubmit in PR form?\n\nI don\u2019t feel strongly - just let\u2019s not get into the weeds.\n\nBrian\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Oct 31, 2017, at 11:36 AM, steige2 <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> In the first bullet, OSG refers to entities that provide a stratum 1 service.

I suspect the real problem is we actually have different understandings of what \"OSG\" means in this context. Perhaps a phone call?
