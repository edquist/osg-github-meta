  "body": "In the first bullet, OSG refers to entities that provide a stratum 1 service. Currently those entities are IU, BNL and FNAL. In the future there may be more. OSG, in general, could include UTA, for example. UTA has no responsibilities in bullet 1 so using OSG here generates an ambiguity. \r\n\r\nI did my best to resolve the ambiguities into what I think they mean in my comments of 11 days ago but it is entirely possible I'm wrong and that's why this needs to be unambiguously resolved. I suspect the real problem is we actually have different understandings of what \"OSG\" means in this context. Perhaps a phone call? I'll do my best to be available.",
