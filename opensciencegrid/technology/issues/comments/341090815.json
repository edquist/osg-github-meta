I would be reluctant to require them to understand the internal structure of the OSG to figure out what we, as the entire project, are providing.\r\n\r\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t NACK a follow-on PR along the lines of what\u2019s in the thread here. I didn\u2019t see anything controversial in Scott\u2019s original suggestion - can you just resubmit in PR form?\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t feel strongly - just let\u2019s not get into the weeds.\r\n\r\nBrian\r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\n> On Oct 31, 2017, at 11:36 AM, steige2 <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:\r\n>\r\n> In the first bullet, OSG refers to entities that provide a stratum 1 service. Currently those entities are IU, BNL and FNAL. In the future there may be more. OSG, in general, could include UTA, for example. UTA has no responsibilities in bullet 1 so using OSG here generates an ambiguity.\r\n>\r\n> I did my best to resolve the ambiguities into what I think they mean in my comments of 11 days ago but it is entirely possible I'm wrong and that's why this needs to be unambiguously resolved. I suspect the real problem is we actually have different understandings of what \"OSG\" means in this context. Perhaps a phone call?
