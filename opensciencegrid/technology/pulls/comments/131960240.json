This document does NOT discuss the policy for deciding what goes into a release, which can be found [here](https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/ReleasePolicy).\n+\n+Due to the length of time that this process takes, it is recommended to do the release over three or more days to allow for errors to be corrected and tests to be run.\n+\n+Requirements\n+------------\n+\n+-   User certificate registered with OSG's koji with build and release team privileges\n+-   An account on UW CS machines (e.g. `library`, `ingwe`) to access UW's AFS\n+-   `release-tools` scripts in your `PATH` ([GitHub](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/release-tools))\n+-   `osg-build` scripts in your `PATH` (installed via OSG yum repos or [source](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-build))\n+\n+Pick the Version Number\n+-----------------------\n+\n+The rest of this document makes references to `<VERSION(S)>` and `<NON-UPCOMING VERSIONS(S)>`, which refer to a space-delimited list of OSG version(s) and that same list minus `upcoming` (e.g. `3.3.28 3.4.3 upcoming` and `3.3.28 3.4.3`). If you are unsure about either the version or revision, please consult the release manager.\n+\n+Day 0: Generate Preliminary Release List\n+----------------------------------------\n+\n+The release manager often needs a tentative list of packages to be released. This is done by finding the package differences between osg-testing and the current release.\n+\n+### Step 1: Update the osg-version RPM\n+\n+For each release (excluding upcoming), update the version number in the osg-version RPM's spec file and build it in koji:\n+\n+```console\n+# If building for the latest release out of trunk\n+[user@client ~] $ osg-build koji osg-version\n+# If building for an older release out of a branch:\n+[user@client ~] $ osg-build koji --repo=<MAJOR VERSION> osg-version\n+```\n+\n+Where `<MAJOR VERSION>` is of the format `x.y` (e.g. `3.2`).\n+\n+### Step 2: Promote osg-version and generate the release list\n+\n+Run `0-generate-pkg-list` from a machine that has your koji-registered user certificate:\n+\n+```console\n+[user@client ~] $ git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/release-tools.git\n+[user@client ~] $ cd release-tools\n+[user@client ~] $ 0-generate-pkg-list <VERSION(S)>\n+```\n+\n+Day 1: Verify Pre-Release and Generate Tarballs\n+-----------------------------------------------\n+\n+This section is to be performed 1-2 days before the release (as designated by the release manager) to perform last checks of the release and create the client tarballs.\n+\n+### Step 1: Verify Pre-Release\n+\n+Compare the list of packages already in pre-release to the final list for the release put together by the OSG Release Coordinator (who should have updated `release-list` in git). To do this, run the `1-verify-prerelease` script from git:\n+\n+```console\n+[user@client ~] $ 1-verify-prerelease <VERSION(S)>\n+```\n+\n+If there are any discrepancies consult the release manager. You may have to tag or untag packages with the `osg-koji` tool.\n+\n+!!! note\n+    Please verify that the `osg-version` RPM is in your set of packages for the release! Also verify that if there is a new version of the `osg-tested-internal` RPM, then it is included in the release as well!\n+\n+### Step 2: Test Pre-Release in VM Universe\n+\n+To test pre-release, you will be kicking off a manual VM universe test run from `osghost.chtc.wisc.edu`.\n+\n+1.  Ensure that you meet the [pre-requisites](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/vm-test-runs) for submitting VM universe test runs\n+2.  Prepare the test suite by running:\n+\n+        [user@client ~] $ osg-run-tests 'Testing OSG pre-release'\n+\n+3.  `cd` into the directory specified in the output of the previous command\n+4.  `cd` into `parameters.d` and remove all files within it except for `osg33-el6.yaml` and `osg33-el7.yaml`\n+5.  Edit `osg33.yaml` so that it reads:\n+\n+        platforms:\n+          - centos_6_x86_64\n+          - rhel_6_x86_64\n+          - sl_6_x86_64\n+          - centos_7_x86_64\n+          - rhel_7_x86_64\n+          - sl_7_x86_64\n+        \n+        sources:\n+          - opensciencegrid:master; 3.3; osg-prerelease\n+          - opensciencegrid:master; 3.3; osg > osg-prerelease\n+        \n+        package_sets:\n+          - label: All (java)\n+            selinux: True\n+            osg_java: True\n+            packages:\n+              - osg-tested-internal\n+              \n+6.
