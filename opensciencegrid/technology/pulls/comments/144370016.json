This is not a service-level agreement but rather a statement of responsibilities.\n+\n+!!! note:\n+    To actually understand the technical procedure for mirroring a repository, [see the following page](https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/OasisExternalRepositories).  This document solely covers the policy aspects.\n+\n+Introduction\n+------------\n+\n+The OSG provides a network of CVMFS Stratum-1 servers for mirroring content of externally-managed repositories.  These repositories are often\n+hosted by large HEP or physics VOs for the purpose of distributing software for high-throughput computing jobs.  Additionally, OSG provides a\n+repository (<oasis.opensciencegrid.org>) for smaller VOs; this is not covered here.\n+\n+OSG will include additional repositories into the content distribution network (CDN) at the request of an OSG-affiliated VO.  These repositories\n+are meant to help the OSG-affiliated VO accomplish their domain science.\n+\n+The goal of this mirroring provides an improved quality-of-service for the VO end-users running at OSG sites.  OSG does not provide support\n+for use of the software in external repositories, but will help end-users contact the VO for help as necessary.\n+\n+OSG Responsibilities\n+---------------------\n+\n+* OSG will provide the Stratum-1 server network according to [the OASIS SLA](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/operations/SLA/oasis-replica/)\n+* OSG will provide a best-effort mirror of the full contents of the external repo.  We will attempt to provide best-effort integrity of the\n+  object contents, but assume users of the Stratum-1 will do further integrity checking.  No SLA is provided covering potential data corruptions.\n+* OSG will provide best-effort notification to the mirrored repository in case OSG detects a service outage of the external repo.\n+* In the event of a reported security incident, OSG will replace the repository contents with an empty directory, signed by an OSG-managed key.\n+* Once the external repository is approved, OSG will distribute the corresponding repository signing keys in a valid whitelist.  The whitelist\n+  will be signed by the OSG Stratum-0.  This whitelist attests to the authenticity of the key, but not a statement about repository contents.\n+\n+VO Responsibilities\n+-------------------\n+* The requesting VO should only include targeted repositories they need to support their science.\n+* The VO should understand that in the event of a reported security incident, the contents of this repository may be replaced with an\n+  empty directory and signed by the OSG repository key.  This will be done after attempting to contact the VO first; the amount of time OSG\n+  will wait on an unresponsive VO will be based on the evaluation of the situation of the OSG Security officer.
