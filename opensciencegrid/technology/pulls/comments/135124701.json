This requires extra work, primarily to prevent dependency issues.\n+\n+Prep work\n+---------\n+\n+### Docs\n+\n+Create a spreadsheet or table of the builds. Table should have NVR, perhaps URL, status (not started, imported, built, tested), and comments (mostly to record if it was a simple pass-through or not).\n+\n+Get packages to update, using `osg-outdated-epel-pkgs` from `opensciencegrid/tools`.\n+\n+To get in N-V-R format:\n+\n+``` console\n+[you@host]$ ./osg-outdated-epel-pkgs | \\\n+    egrep '^(globus|myproxy|gsi)' | \\\n+    awk 'BEGIN {OFS=\"\"} {print $1, \"-\", $3}'\n+```\n+\n+or to split up N and V-R in a comma-separated way (which you can feed into a Google Sheet to turn it into two columns):\n+\n+``` console\n+[you@host]$ ./osg-outdated-epel-pkgs | \\\n+    egrep '^(globus|myproxy|gsi)' | \\\n+    awk 'BEGIN {OFS=\"\"} {print $1, \",\", $3}'\n+```\n+\n+### SVN\n+\n+Create a separate SVN branch and populate it with all the packages you will update.

Koji admins as of August 2017 are Mat Selmeci and Carl Edquist.\n+\n+Ensure Koji tags exist: a destination tag, and a build tag, one for each dver, e.g.:\n+\n+-   el6-globus\n+-   el6-globus-build\n+-   el7-globus\n+-   el7-globus-build\n+\n+Set up tag inheritence: base the build tags off of the corresponding `dist-el?-build` tag. This is because we don't want old osg packages interfering with the new versions we're building. These may already exist -- check the `el?-globus-build` tags in the web interface.\n+\n+``` console\n+[you@host]$ for el in el6 el7; do \\\n+        osg-koji add-tag --parent=dist-$el-build \\\n+            --arches=x86_64 $el-globus-build; \\\n+    done\n+```\n+\n+Tag `buildsys-macros` for the OSG release into the build tags:\n+\n+``` console\n+[you@host]$ for el in el6 el7; do \\\n+       buildsys_macros_nvr=$(osg-koji -q list-tagged osg-3.4-$el-development \\\n+         buildsys-macros --latest | awk '{print $1}'); \\\n+       osg-koji tag-pkg $el-globus-build $buildsys_macros_nvr; \\\n+   done\n+```\n+\n+Ensure Koji targets exist, one for each dver, e.g.:\n+\n+-   el6-globus (el6-globus-build &rarr; el6-globus)\n+-   el7-globus (el7-globus-build &rarr; el7-globus)\n+-   kojira-fake-el6-globus (el6-globus &rarr; kojira-fake)\n+-   kojira-fake-el7-globus (el7-globus &rarr; kojira-fake)\n+\n+``` console\n+[you@host]$ for el in el6 el7; do \\\n+       osg-koji add-target $el-globus $el-globus-build $el-globus; \\\n+       osg-koji add-target kojira-fake-$el-globus $el-globus kojira-fake; \\\n+   done\n+```\n+\n+If basing the packages off of the Globus repos, add the Globus repos as external repos, and add them to the build tags (but not the dest tags).\n+\n+Edit `/etc/koji-hub/plugins/sign.conf` and set up the GPG signing for the RPMs. Run `/etc/koji-hub/plugins/fix-permissions` after editing the file.\n+\n+Per-package work\n+----------------\n+\n+1.  cd into branches/globus\n+2.
