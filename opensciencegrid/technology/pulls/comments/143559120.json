This will result in\n+packages from those series becoming unavailable both to users, and to developers.\n+\n+\n+Policy\n+------\n+\n+We should delete a release series only when needing to download a package from\n+that series is improbable.  I propose the following rule:\n+\n+Delete a release series when the _following_ series is completely out of\n+support.  For example, OSG 3.1 can be deleted when OSG 3.2 is out of support,\n+and OSG 3.2 can be deleted when OSG 3.3 is out of support.\n+\n+\n+Tasks\n+-----\n+\n+Deleting a release series requires work from both Operations and Software &\n+Release.  The first step is to create a JIRA ticket in the SOFTWARE project to\n+track the work.\n+\n+Operations tasks should be completed before Software & Release tasks.\n+\n+\n+### Operations\n+\n+These tasks should be completed in order.\n+\n+1.  Two weeks in advance, notify sites (including mirror sites) that the\n+    release series is going away.\n+\n+2.  Remove the series from the mash configs on the repo.grid.iu.edu machines.\n+\n+3.  Remove the appropriate mirrorlist directories from `/usr/local/mirror/osg`.\n+\n+4.  Remove the appropriate repo directories from `/usr/local/repo/osg`.\n+\n+5.  Wait for mash to run and verify that the repos are no longer getting\n+    updated:\n+\n+    -  Look at the mash logs in `/var/log/repo`.\n+    -  Verify that the repo directory under `/usr/local/repo/osg` did not get",
