If you are not running the Ansible commands from\n+osghost, there are almost certainly other prerequisites that are not listed below.  And even using osghost for Ansible\n+and itb-submit for the submissions, there may be other prerequisites missing.  Please improve this document by adding\n+other prerequisites as they are identified!\n+\n+* A checkout of the osgitb directory from our local git instance (not GitHub)\n+* Your X.509 DN in the `osgitb/unmanaged/htcondor/condor_mapfile` file and (via Ansible) on `itb-ce1` and `itb-ce2`\n+\n+## Gather Information\n+\n+Technically skippable, this section is about checking on the state of the ITB machines before making changes.  The plan\n+is to keep the ITB machines generally up-to-date independently, so those steps are not listed here.  And honestly, the\n+steps below are just some ideas; do whatever makes sense for the given update.\n+\n+The commands can be run as-is from within the `osgitb` directory from git.\n+\n+1. Check OS versions for all current ITB hosts:\n+\n+        :::console\n+        ansible current -i inventory -f 20 -o -m command -a 'cat /etc/redhat-release'\n+\n+2. Check HTCondor versions for all HTCondor hosts:\n+\n+        :::console\n+        ansible condor -i inventory -f 20 -o -m command -a 'rpm -q condor'\n+\n+3. Obtain the NVR of the HTCondor prerelease build from OSG to test.  Do this by talking to Tim&nbsp;T. and checking\n+   Koji.  The expectation is that the HTCondor prerelease build will be in the development repository (or\n+   upcoming-development).\n+\n+## Install HTCondor Prerelease\n+\n+1. Shut down HTCondor and HTCondor-CE on prerelease machines:\n+\n+        :::console\n+        ansible condordev -i inventory -bK -f 20 -m service -a 'name=condor-ce state=stopped' -l 'itb-ce*'\n+        ansible condordev -i inventory -bK -f 20 -m service -a 'name=condor state=stopped'\n+\n+2. Install new version of HTCondor on prerelease machines:\n+\n+        :::console\n+        ansible condordev -i inventory -bK -f 10 -m command -a 'yum --enablerepo=osg-upcoming --assumeyes update condor'",
