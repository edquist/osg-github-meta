It is meant primarily for OSG Software team members who need to interact with the service.\n+\n+Terminology\n+-----------\n+\n+Using and understanding the following terminology correctly will help in the reading of this document:\n+\n+**Package:**  \n+This refers to a named piece of software in the Koji database. An example would be \"lcmaps\".\n+\n+**Build**  \n+A specific version and release of a package, and an associated state. A build state may be successful (and contain RPMs), failed, or in-progress. A given build may be in one or more tags. The build is associated with the output of the latest build task with the same version and release of the package.\n+\n+**Tag**  \n+A named set of packages and builds, parent tags, and reference to external repositories. An example would be the \"osg-3.3-el6-development\" tag, which contains (among others) the \"lcmaps\" package and the \"lcmaps-1.6.6-1.1.osg33.el6\" build. There is an inheritance structure to tags: by default, all packages/builds in a parent tag are added to the tag. A tag may contain a reference to (possibly inherited) external repositories; the RPMs in these repositories are added to repositories created from this tag. Examples of referenced external repositories include CentOS base, EPEL, or JPackage.\n+\n+-   A tag is NOT a yum repository.\n+\n+**Target**  \n+A target consists of a build tag and a destination tag. An example is \"osg-3.3-el6\", where the build tag is \"osg-3.3-el6-build\" and the destination tag is \"osg-3.3-el6\". A target is used by the build task to know what repository to build from and tag to build into.\n+\n+**Task**  \n+A unit of work for Koji. Several common tasks are:\n+\n+-   build  \n+    This task takes a SRPM and a target, and attempts to create a complete Build in the target's destination tag from the target's build repository. This task will launch one buildArch task for each architecture in the destination tag; if each subtask is successful, then it will launch a tagBuild subtask.\n+\n+    -   Note that if the build task is marked as \"scratch\", then it won't result in a Build.",
