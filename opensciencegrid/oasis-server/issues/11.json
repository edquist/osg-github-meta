  "body": "Brian, please merge.  cvmfs_rsync has already been in production use for fermilab.opensciencegrid.org and is to be contributed upstream (CVM-814).  The only modification to it to support deleting directories  with '.' containing .cvmfscatalog was to add 'shopt -s dotglob' to get bash to match dot files.  I have tested this change on oasis-itb with a scratch build, waiting on a merge to do final build.\n",
