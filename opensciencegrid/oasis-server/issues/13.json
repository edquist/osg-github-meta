  "body": "[first] new code and config files for a daemon to run the snapshots at Stratum-1s via a service (daemon) instead of a cron. This first commit includes the code, two config files, the sysconfig config file, the init.d file, and the setup.py modified.\nSome of the rationale (but not all reasons):\n -- based on config files\n-- each repo is a separate section in the config file, so can be configured (including enabling/disabling) separately\n-- it prevents 2 replica tasks from working at the same time for the same repo when a new cron cycle starts but the previous one didn't finish yet (already happened)\n-- in future versions, we can randomize the time between cycles, with some back-off algorithm in case of failures. Right now it just tries N times, one after another\n-- it can be started/stopped from command line, without editing the cron file\n-- it runs each snapshot in a separate thread. So they are asynchronous instead of serial\n-- it is in python, so it will make easier in the future to integrate other functionalities\n    ---- audit the remote stratum-0 db first\n    ---- run monitoring tasks\n    ---- ... \n\nI did some tests with success. But needs to be fully tested on ITB replica. \nIdea will be to distribute this service in its own RPM. \n",
