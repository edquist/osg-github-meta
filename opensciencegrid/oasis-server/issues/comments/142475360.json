Currently do_oasis_update is reading .cvmfsdirtab from /net/nas01/srv.  That's not where the rest of the files are anymore that persist across reinstalls, those are now mounted at /srv.  This pull request changes do_oasis_update so that file, the last one still referenced in /net/nas01/srv, will be with the rest of the files.  (Note: there are still files referenced in /net/nas01/Public, but that's OK).\n",
