  "body": "I ran the most current unit tests and they were all successful. There are very few logic changes and they are straightforward in nature (e.g. remove catching of exceptions that only served to re-raise the exception, refactoring duplicate statements). The other changes were tackling the simplest pylint errors.\n\n@osg-cat: I assigned this to you for now but I can just merge this if you're not interested in going through the giant diff. I'm confident that everything is functioning with the successful unit tests.\n",
