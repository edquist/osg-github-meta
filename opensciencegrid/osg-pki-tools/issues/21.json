To do anything useful in it you end up having to fix a million other things.\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\n- We can remove the `python-simplejson` dependency but we'll need to add `python-argparse` for EL6\r\n- All `GridAdminCertRequests` and `CertRequest` tests pass. The other tests are useless so I didn't run them (we should think about ripping them out)\r\n- We should definitely tag 2.0.0 with this massive PR\r\n\r\nI don't expect anyone to review this massive headache, just getting this in for posterity",
