  "body": "I know this is a big PR but working on `osg-pki-tools` can be a bit like [replacing a lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1CYncXkCv4). Here are the highlights:\n- Basic pylint fixes: whitespaces, indentation, non-Pythonic formatting, etc (the bulk of the PR)\n- Fix timeout option to respect tool runtime ([SOFTWARE-2258](https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2258))\n- Added `-t/--timeout` to the tools that didn't have it. This caused a conflict in `osg-cert-request` with the `-t/--hostname` option so I changed that to `-H/--hostname` to match `osg-gridadmin-cert-request`. I could just as easily drop this change but common options across the tools really should be called the same way. I suppose we should bump the minor version number if we keep it.\n- Bug fixes:\n  - Interrupting `osg-gridadmin-cert-request` resulted in a NameError\n  - When `KeyError` and `HTTPExceptions` were caught, `osg-gridadmin-cert-request` exited 0\n  - Catch `SSLError` when using an expired cert\n\nI ran the unit tests that I wrote a few months ago against all these changes and they all worked with the exception of the `CertRevokeTests` because of non-pki-tool related issue with OIM-ITB. \n\nI could break this up into different PRs but a lot of the changes (particularly the pylint ones) are all in the same areas. \n",
