  "body": "Ah, it looks like at least the rpm takes care of marking them executable (the ones installed under `/usr/bin`).  Anyway, it should work as you have it.\n\nMaybe for future consideration... My thought is actually that any scripts you intend to invoke that start with a `#!` line really ought to be executable and invoked directly (rather than explicitly passing it to the interpreter, in this case `/bin/sh`).\n\n(Interestingly, for the scripts in question here, `osg-user-cert-revoke` is shell, but it invokes `osg-cert-revoke` directly, which is python --but not executable-- in the sources.  The rpm makes it executable, but for non-rpm installs my guess is this will fail with permission denied.)\n",
