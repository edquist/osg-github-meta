  "body": "This release contains a major refactoring of `osg-cert-request` and `osg-gridadmin-cert-request` along with their relevant functions in the `OSGPKIUtils.py` and `ConnectAPI.py` libraries. Additionally, we've added the following features:\r\n\r\n- `osg-cert-request` now defaults to authenticated requests if a user certificate and key are available. Force unauthenticated requests with `--unauthenticated` ([SOFTWARE-2898](https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2898))\r\n- Certificate request quota verification is now performed server-side ([SOFTWARE-2472](https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2472))",
