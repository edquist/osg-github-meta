  "body": "@brianhlin - we tend to have config files in `/etc/condor-ce/config.d` for two reasons:\r\n1.  Historical: they were here before they were in `/usr/share/condor-ce` and we wanted some continuity.\r\n2.  We want to communicate / highlight some config setting the admin may want to change.\r\n\r\nDoes either apply here?  The only potential tunable is `AUDIT_PAYLOAD_MAX_HOURS`, but I suspect that the admin would have to be such a deep expert to want to tune that they don't need the help text.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to just suggest removing this file completely; seems it would make things simpler.",
