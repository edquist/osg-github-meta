  "body": "This provides two new pieces of functionality:\n1) Allow the site-level HTCondor-CE collector to accept startd ads\n   from worker nodes; advertise the collector's address in the job\n   environment.  This is meant to work in conjunction with a new\n   gWMS feature in 3.2.9 / 3.2.10 (exact release unknown) which advertises\n   the pilot startd ad.  This will enable Miron's long-standing\n   request to make pilot ads visible to the CEs.\n2) Implement a new attribute, minWalltime, which specifies a minimum\n   valid runtime for a job; if the pilot runs for less than this amount\n   of time, it is considered to be a problematic job and put on hold.\n   This will allow site admins more visibility into problem pilots and\n   worker nodes.\n",
