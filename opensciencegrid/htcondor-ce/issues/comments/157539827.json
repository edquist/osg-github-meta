I'm not sure if this is a big deal but if we want to address this, we can throw `:` in front of each of those lines like in [03-ce-shared-port.conf](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/htcondor-ce/blob/master/config/03-ce-shared-port.conf#L18-L23).\n\nI also assume that even though the CEMON (Are we actually going with that name? We really should change it to avoid confusion with the old CEMon) is in the `DC_DAEMON_LIST` it won't be started since it's not in the `DAEMON_LIST` by default, correct?\n",
