  "body": "Ok I moved the default file, and successfully tested this with my own build of htcondor-8.6.4-1.1 on both EL6 and EL7.  Unfortunately it does not work with the OSG build of htcondor-8.6.4-1.1, on either O.S., and I don't know why yet.  The CollectorLog shows it loading /usr/libexec/condor/libcollector_python_plugin.so, so it's not the problem we had with 8.6.3, but it doesn't run the audit_payloads plugin nor print any error from it.  My build came directly from htcondor's build-on-linux.sh",
