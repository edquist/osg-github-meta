There's also a condor@parent principal.\n> \n> Examples: commands from the Shadow to the Schedd would be authorized as condor@child in the Schedd.  Commands from the Schedd to the Master (like the \"I'm still alive\" message) would also be condor@child in the Master.  A command from the Master to the Schedd (like \"Shutdown now\") would be authorized in the Schedd as \"condor@parent\".\n",
