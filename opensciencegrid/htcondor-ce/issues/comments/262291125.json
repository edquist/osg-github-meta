  "body": "1. Results in an obscenely long hold message. Even if it lists the possible issues it's very unhelpful beyond that. What do users do if they don't have the right job route, the job route is full, or their failure rate threshold has been reached? How do they know which error case they've encountered if we list all the possible issues? We can answer those questions via documentation and if that's the case, why not just give the shortened, unique hold message?\r\n1. We can add a link but I think it's unnecessary with the correct document being the top link for the 'troubleshooting htcondor-ce' google search",
