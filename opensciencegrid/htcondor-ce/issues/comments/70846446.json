  "body": "> The downsides of version-based:\n> 1) Didn't OSG patch in this tool for a given version - but UW did not? Hence, condor_version may not be a reliable indicator.\n\nNot sure about that \u2013 I will have to check with Tim T., probably.\n\n> 2) We've at least seen one site where two versions of HTCondor were in $PATH; that means parsing \"condor_version\" would also be unreliable.\n\nWell, if we invoke \u201ccondor_version\u201d with no path component and then we invoke condor_ce_\\* also with no path component, wouldn\u2019t both executables come from the same HTCondor directory, even if more than one HTCondor was in $PATH? (Assuming that we picked the right condor_ce_\\* name based on the version, of course.) I guess I can\u2019t quite see where the unreliability would come from, but I am probably missing something.\n\n\u2014 Tim=\n",
