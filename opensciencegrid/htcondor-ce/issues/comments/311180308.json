  "body": "Hi Brian. Thank you for taking a look. On first glance, I agree with your suggestion. Though I believe there are two paths to worry about:\r\n* CE => Grid manager (slurm, pbs, lsf, sge, etc.)\r\n* CE => Condor\r\n\r\nThe grid manager [removes](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/blob/f7ac6cce/src/condor_gridmanager/infnbatchjob.cpp#L1649) the \"remote_\" prefix from attributes, converting remote_X to X. But condor receives all the attributes without any mangling.\r\n\r\n| Destination  | Input attribute       | Output attribute      |\r\n| ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |\r\n| Grid manager |        OriginalMemory |                _none_ |\r\n| Grid manager | remote_OriginalMemory |        OriginalMemory |\r\n| Condor       |        OriginalMemory |        OriginalMemory |\r\n| Condor       | remote_OriginalMemory | remote_OriginalMemory |\r\n\r\nWe need the \"OriginalMemory\" attribute to be set in the output for both paths, grid manager and condor. Duplicating the expression seems ugly, but I think some sort of duplication is required.",
