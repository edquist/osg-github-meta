  "body": "I have updated the pull request to be able to handle job stops from glideinWMS partitionable slots.  It is unfortunately considerably more complicated because sometimes there aren't stop messages received for the individual slots.  It has to parse the name to look for \"slotN@X\" which can indicate to stop all jobs with the corresponding names \"slotN_M@X\".\r\n\r\nI also updated the spec file to require condor >= 8.6.5.",
