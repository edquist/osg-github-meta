  "body": "Hi @kreczko, no HTCONDORCE_CORES refers to the number of Logical CPUS in a single execute node.\n\nThe total cores in the cluster is calculated by querying the COLLECTOR_HOST using the python bindings. \n\nThe reason it's hard-coded here is that some people run vastly differing hardware setups in their pools, e.g. most nodes might be 8 core, but they may have a large number of 32-core nodes.\n\nWe could average by querying node cpus through the collector but then we'd need to floor it and then it doesn't exactly reflect reality. Rather than that approach I decided to leave it up to the site admin.\n\nHappy to come up with a better approach if you have ideas.\n",
