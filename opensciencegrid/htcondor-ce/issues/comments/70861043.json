  "body": "Tim and I had a discussion this morning:\n- If a user has two different versions of HTCondor installed with 8.3.x later in the path, the current version of the CE tool will use condor_job_router_info. This behavior is slightly different than our other wrapper scripts that use the binaries that are first in path. Instead, we should `which` for something that should be in every install (i.e., condor_version) and construct the path to the executables that way.\n- We should probably use /bin/which in case the user has any aliases for which\n",
