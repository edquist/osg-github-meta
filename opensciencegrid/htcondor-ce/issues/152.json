  "body": "Hi @djw8605, @brianhlin, and @bbockelm,\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting failed jobs, I found that the memory requirements were not passing through BLAHP to the local scheduler (pbs_submit.sh -> SLURM).\r\n\r\nWhen passing a job to a GAHP server, gridmanager [copies](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor/blob/f7ac6cce/src/condor_gridmanager/infnbatchjob.cpp#L1381-L1396) a limited list of attributes, which includes RequestMemory.\r\n\r\nWith the whole node changes (#142), RequestMemory is now an expression that includes OriginalMemory. But, OriginalMemory is not passed along by gridmanager, so BLAHP cannot evaluate RequestMemory.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this PR as an ugly proof-of-concept. It appears to get RequestMemory passed to the local scheduler, but I'd appreciate your help on making it cleaner.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohn",
