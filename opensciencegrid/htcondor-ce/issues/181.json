After it tries to get a new security session, it's running as the 'condor' user so it can't access the hostkey, can't send keepalives, and the master kills it. \r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nPrefer FS auth over GSI for the master and only auth the CE View via FS. We don't fix this for the central collector because the OSG cc uses IP load balancing and certs with SANs, which don't work in HTCondor for auth (https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=6135,86).",
