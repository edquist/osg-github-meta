Job did not match any available job routes\r\n2. All potential job routes are full (i.e. reached MaxJobs)\r\n3. Routed jobs are failing and throttling occurs; job submission rates\r\ndrop and the job router does not pick up new jobs until the failure\r\nrate drops below the configured threshold\r\n\r\nRather than including them in a very long hold message, it makes more\r\nsense to elaborate the reasons in our documentation.",
