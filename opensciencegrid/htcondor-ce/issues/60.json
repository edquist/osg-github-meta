  "body": "Here are a couple of info providers for BDII GLUE1.3 and GLUE2 publication.\n\nHandles multi-CE sites and allows users to specify their site-specific values inside HTCondor-CE config, meaning that there's no need for extra config outside of the CE.\n\nI've left the spec changes out as the one in head seems out-of-date. I'm envisioning a bdii sub-package, which has a Require on bdii.\n\nifdef'd out for OSG builds.\n\nProviders would need to be installed in /var/lib/bdii/gip/provider/ owned by the ldap user/group.\n\nLet me know if you need any changes or have any comments/corrections.\n",
