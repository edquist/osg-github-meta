  "body": "To expand on what @edquist is saying after a discussion I had with him, the probe runs checksums on each CA it can find and compare it to the list of checksums on `repo` so the CA version is irrelevant for this probe's functionality. Either they have a new RSV that performs sha256sum and compares them to `repo`'s `cacerts_sha256sum-new.txt` or they have an old RSV that performs md5sum and compares them to `repo`'s `cacerts_md5sum-new.txt`, which we are still providing.",
