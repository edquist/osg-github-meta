  "body": "Added a space check for the destination directory and also saved it as a variable to be sent to the ES index. We need to curl to uct2-int.mwt2.org:9951 now which is handled by a Python script we've tested to re-direct job data to the usual ES host. In Kibana it can be found in \"stashcp-*\". Before, uct2-es-door.mwt2.org was not accepting curls from stashcp.\n",
