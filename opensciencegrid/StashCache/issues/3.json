  "body": "Ilija and I think that the du command in downloading_timeout.sh is never reading any disk usage because unix wouldn't see any disk usage during a file transfer without the use of sync before the du command. We have proposed this, along with minor changes to the loop to check every $timeout seconds as opposed to every 1 second, and moving the kill command to inside the timeout condition, rather than at the end of the loop \n(echo \"killing process after timeout of $timeout seconds\"\n-   kill $$)\n\nIn stashcp, we updated the curl command to point to the current host, as I understand we are not using the hadoop cluster for this purpose at the moment. Let me know what you think and thanks.\n\nTony\n",
