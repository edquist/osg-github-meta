  "body": "This is the current version of stashcp and downloading_timeout.sh I have been using locally that has fixed many of the original errors for me.\n\ndownloading_timeout.sh now kills xrdcp properly in the case of a timeout, keeps its exit code whether it is killed or aborts itself, and reports it to ES. \nstashcp has variables added to its ES index, including checkpoints of where stashcp aborted if it did, and why. It also uses a newer version of xrootd.\n",
