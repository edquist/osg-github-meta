  "body": "I think you'd have to check on EL6, but `yum` requires `pyxattr` on EL7.  So, there's a good possibility that it is available.  It appears `libattr` (which is needed by `pyxattr`) is a dependency for `coreutils`, so that's probably pretty globally available.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to work with Suchandra on this though - we need to decide whether `stashcp` should use python from CVMFS or the system.\r\n\r\nRegardless - you can probably have the following sequence:\r\n1.  If `xattr` module is available, then use that.\r\n2.  Else, `popen` the `attr` command line utility.\r\n3.  Else, use the hardcoded server list.  As with `caches.json`, can we move the server list out of python and into a hardcoded file?  Maybe just put this in `caches.json` itself?",
