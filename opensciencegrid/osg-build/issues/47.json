This is more future-proofing than anything that's useful right now -- for one, RHEL 6/7 do not include Python 3 versions of yum/rpm libraries.\r\n\r\nI've been using this for the past month or two with Python 2 so there are likely no regressions; I also tested the code on Fedora 26/27 and it works fine there, other than problems with the Koji libraries themselves (our password caching and proxy cert patches don't work on the Python 3 version of Koji).",
