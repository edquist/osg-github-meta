  "body": "This verifies pretty much the same rules as SVN in terms of having a clean working directory and merged with the origin.  For OSG repos, it additionally checks that git / SVN are not out of sync and that the branch rules are in effect.\n\nAdditionally, this adds a CLI option (--repo) which allows you to switch between osg / upcoming / hcc / uscms.\n\nI hand tested the various synchronization rules and got as far as I could in testing with koji (ran afoul of UW's allowed_scms list).  Looking at the koji source code, I think everything is ready to roll.\n",
