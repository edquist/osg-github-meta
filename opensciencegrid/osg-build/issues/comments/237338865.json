No problem if not.\n\nEven just changing the imports alone ends up touching many lines throughout, without any functional changes; with everything in a single commit it's a bit more of a task to follow the individual changes.\n\n(I'll assume you don't have the time or motivation to break it up, but feel to if you do.)\n",
