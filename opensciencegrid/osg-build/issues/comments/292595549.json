  "body": "Hi........\r\n\r\nI can work with this format, although i think i would still like to support other options.  Eg I still think it'd be worthwhile to support a sha1sum for the upstream file itself, because we have lots of upstream sources which are not directly derived from a git-archive. I'm happy to implement that, and it doesn't need to block this request.  (Truth be told, i still like the idea of implementing support for a simple `UPSTREAM_PATH/filename [SHA1SUM]` ...)\r\n\r\nIf we are going to support the format in this PR, it would be nice to have a toolish way to get at the target upstream file.  But i won't worry so much about that if this is mostly for use at hcc.\r\n\r\nThings to fix in this PR:\r\n- remove all the references to JSON (eg in comments)\r\n- remove all the now-unnecessary `str()` casts (i assume they were put there in the first place because json returned `unicode` objects\r\n- strip a leading `v` from tag names when generating the name-version prefix (as github does)",
