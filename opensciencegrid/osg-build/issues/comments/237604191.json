  "body": "It might \"taste\" better when you are running osg-build alone, but it seems like you lose information (the loglevel and even the program name, which might be relevant if this is run in the context of a larger script) ... Also if anybody ever built scripts around osg-build to parse its output (I'm sure I have in the past), I suppose this change could break it, so in any case if you want to make this change it should be documented in the changelog/release notes at least.  Maybe nobody will notice but you never know...\n\nOn some level, I wonder, if we are dropping the `%(levelname)s:osg-build:` prefix, what does a prefix of `>>` add over no prefix?  (That is, does it distinguish it from other output lines or something?  Or does it make it easier to see where lines start?)\n\nThose are my thoughts, but really I don't have a strong opinion about it -- either way works.\n",
