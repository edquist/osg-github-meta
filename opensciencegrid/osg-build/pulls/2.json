If uscms wants to have a testing / release split, they'll also need the changes to the get_tag function.\n\nNote that this could support the OSG 3.1 / 3.2 split if we kept the name of the \"primary\" release tags to \"osg-release\" and just added new routes for OSG 3.1.  Otherwise, we'd need an osg-build release per major version (which, considering, is not that horrible).\n",
