For OSG repos, it additionally checks that git / SVN are not out of sync and that the branch rules are in effect.\n\nAdditionally, this adds a CLI option (--repo) which allows you to switch between osg / upcoming / hcc / uscms.\n\nI hand tested the various synchronization rules and got as far as I could in testing with koji (ran afoul of UW's allowed_scms list).
