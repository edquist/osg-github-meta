  "body": "This release adds some exciting new improvements to the GridFTP checksum code.  A new checksum type, `CVMFS` is added, which provides a checksum per fixed-sized block within the file.  As the name suggests, this is precisely the checksum type used internally within CVMFS (see https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem), providing an easy mechanism for publishing the contents of a GridFTP server into CVMFS.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, special thanks goes out to @JasonAlt who provided several useful bugfixes for this release:\r\n- Edge cases around zero-sized files are handled correctly.\r\n- Deadlocks around the separate HDFS log monitor thread are now avoided.\r\n- Additionally, Jason found and fixed a few memory and file permission issues in the CVMFS code prior to its release.",
