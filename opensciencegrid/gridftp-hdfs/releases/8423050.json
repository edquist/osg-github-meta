  "body": "This release fixes a potential double-free that may occur when a checksum file must be regenerated due to an added checksum type.\r\n\r\nThis double-free was observed at UCSD when CVMFS checksums were requested for files written prior to the CVMFS-style checksum support.\r\n\r\nFurther, this release fixes a potential deadlock in the `SIGSEGV` signal handler due to prior use of async signal unsafe functions.",
