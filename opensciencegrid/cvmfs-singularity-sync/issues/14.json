  "body": "My goal is to retire`ligo/ligo-wn` in favor of `ligo/software`. Options in my order of preference:\r\n\r\n1. Freeze `ligo-wn:latest` as it currently stands and tell people who are using it to move by X/Y/2017.\r\n1. Make `/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/ligo/ligo-wn:latest` a symbolic link to `/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/ligo/software:jessie`.\r\n\r\nPlease do not merge unless you are confident that you can keep `ligo-wn` working in one of these capacities. I think the user base is presently 0, but I'd rather operate on assumption that it's being used and plan a proper transition.",
