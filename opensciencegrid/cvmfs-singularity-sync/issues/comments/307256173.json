We recently turned off my gwms frontend daemon (the one configured\nwith the frontend.xml config file, not the condor frontends) to use one\nthat is being operated by central OSG services on our behalf. Is there\nanything I need to do to change my configuration on my frontend schedd and\ncollector hosts to recognize the new location?\n\n-Richard J.\n\nOn Thu, Jun 8, 2017 at 3:09 AM, Brian Bockelman <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi Richard - one small favor to ask.
