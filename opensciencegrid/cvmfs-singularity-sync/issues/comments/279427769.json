This works a lot better when I actually press the \"merge\" button.  *Now* it should be available within the hour.\r\n\r\nFYI - we strongly recommend to base images on Docker's automated build infrastructure (see https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/).  This way, others can replicate your image and you can automatically get security updates when the underlying OS updates.",
