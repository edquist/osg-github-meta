  "body": "The `VOMSACValidator` spawns a helper thread for each instance and re-loads\nthe CRLs for each new instance.  Hence, it's too heavyweight to do an instance\nper validation request.\n\nOTOH, the actual validation is done in a synchronized method, meaning only one\nthread can validate at a time per `VOMSACValidator` object.  So, it's also\ninappropriate to be a global object.\n\nHere, I split the difference and have it be a thread-local.\n",
