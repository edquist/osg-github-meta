  "body": "This branch (besides fixing some pom.xml issues) creates a new JSON-based API for GUMS, allowing for drastically simpler interaction with the service.\n\nIt's useful for testing.  For example:\n\n```\n# curl --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ --cert /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem --key /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem 'https://gums.example.com:8443/gums/json/mapGridIdentity?subject-x509-id=/DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic%20Units/OU=Users/CN=bbockelm/CN=659869/CN=Brian%20Paul%20Bockelman&dns-host-name=foo.example.com&voms-fqan=/cms'\n{\"result\":\"OK\",\"username\":\"cms001\"}\n```\n\nI dare you to create the same request with SOAP ;)\n\nWhile the testing is useful on its own, this work was done per stakeholder request from the FNAL FIFE team.\n",
