  "body": "Yeah, found it quicker do `git rm ...` in my fork instead of `git mv...` which would make my move clearer, understood. It's not complete re-work, I should have used different phrase - there is quite a lot to be edited in existing files, indeed. The structure is not very `rhel7` friendly nor the code of `stachcache` script. That's what I meant by re-work. Plus we'll be adding things for auth vs non-auth StashCache configuration. Anyway, I don't mind if we don't merge this pull request now, we can merge later when things do not look ugly in the follow up pull request(s).",
