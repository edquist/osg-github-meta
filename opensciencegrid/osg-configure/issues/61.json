  "body": "This fixes logging in ensure_valid_user_vo_file and makes it so that the gums server doesn't get queried if there's already a working user-vo-map, which should get rid of the performance issues.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n* the 'this may take a while' warning only shows up in the logfile, which is pretty useless. I think it will be fixed when I get around to fixing the logging (SOFTWARE-2744)\r\n* the user-vo-map file gets populated once, and then never updated; normally, gums-host-cron runs from cron and updates it. I will make a new ticket for that",
