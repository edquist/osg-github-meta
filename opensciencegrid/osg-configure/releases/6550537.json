  "body": "The big change for this release is how the `allowed_vos` attribute in the `Subcluster`/`Resource Entry` sections is handled: \r\n- As of OSG-Configure 2.0.0 (OSG 3.4), `allowed_vos` will become mandatory, so the user is warned if it is unspecified.\r\n- Autodetection of `allowed_vos` based on existing Unix accounts now works when using `vomsmap` auth, and is done for subclusters where `allowed_vos` is \"`*`\".\r\n- Explicitly setting `allowed_vos` to the empty string has become a warning. It will become an error in OSG-Configure 2.0.0.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in the `Storage` section, `app_dir` and `data_dir` no longer have to exist on the CE. If they are missing, a warning is issued, but OSG-Configure keeps running.\r\n\r\nThis release contains fixes for the following tickets:\r\n- SOFTWARE-2703 reject empty allowed_vos in subclusters\r\n- SOFTWARE-2670 get default allowed_vos with lcmaps_voms_plugin\r\n- SOFTWARE-2674 unnecessary check for OSG_APP and OSG_DATA",
