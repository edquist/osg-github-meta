  "body": "(SOFTWARE-2789)\r\n\r\nThis release of osg-configure contains two changes:\r\n* the `condor-python` dependency has been made optional. This is mostly a packaging change, as the modules that require condor-python (`infoservices`, `subcluster`, `resourcecatalog`) will no longer get installed unless the package `osg-configure-infoservices` is installed. The only code change here is for the test code: tests for modules that are not installed now get skipped. (SOFTWARE-2757)\r\n* GUMS-based auth now uses the GUMS JSON interface if `gums-host-cron` is not installed. (A future version of osg-configure will make the GUMS JSON interface preferred.) (SOFTWARE-2482)\r\n\r\nThese changes are also in release 1.9.0.",
