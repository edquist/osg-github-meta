  "body": "The first release for OSG 3.4 only, this release removed or disabled features that are no longer supported in OSG 3.4 (many of which are also unsupported or barely supported in OSG 3.3). The dropped features are:\r\n* managedfork and network config, which was GRAM only and unsupported on 3.3 as well (SOFTWARE-2705)\r\n* GRAM configuration, which is unsupported on 3.3 as well and now raises an error when the user tries to request GRAM (SOFTWARE-2726)\r\n* glexec - now raises an error when the user tries to request it (SOFTWARE-2697)\r\n* osg-cleanup - also GRAM-only, and has been a no-op for a while (SOFTWARE-2695)\r\n* the \"configure-osg\" symlink to the osg-configure script (SOFTWARE-2743)\r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n* the default auth method was changed to \"vomsmap\". Requesting \"xacml\" (i.e. GUMS) auth now raises a warning (SOFTWARE-2737)\r\n* an empty \"allowed_vos\" attribute is no longer allowed in Subcluster or Resource Entry sections (SOFTWARE-2703)\r\n\r\nThis release includes all the changes from 1.8.0 as well.",
